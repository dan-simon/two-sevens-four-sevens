## 1.

Having everything collapse around you is, to put it lightly, not that great. Thus, it was somewhat worrisome when I was woken up by a loud noise of something breaking and a feeling of sudden freefall, followed by a shock which, though I was still half-asleep, I determined to be due to my bed landing on the first (ground) floor of the building I was in. I looked at the scene around me. My first reaction was that the damage was heavily localized; above me, the third floor seemed fine, and the rest of the second floor (from which I fell) also seemed to be undamaged. My second reaction was noticing the tree. A few branches of it were lying near me, and I realized that, most likely, the collapse was due to it falling though the wall separating my room from the outside, then breaking through the floor and causing the floor to collapse. It was lucky, I thought, that the tree had happened to fall near my bed rather than on it, and for that matter that my bed had stayed upright during its (albeit brief) fall. Then I looked in more detail at the tree.

{Commentary on the next paragraph: it's hard to find a word for what I want to mean by "monastery". Some of the monasteries in this society are what we would consider monasteries, where people work on spiritual stuff. Others are more like universities. The one about to be discussed is sort of in between. It was initially formed "to recognize the goodness and beauty of nature and especially trees", but over time it's started studying nature in general and trees in particular from a more scientific perspective. In any case, in the societies of this story, the distinctions are viewed as more of a spectrum of types of isolated gatherings of more than a few people.}

As a member of the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery, which focused mostly on the study of trees and specifically the eponymous circular grove of seven trees, and also as someone who liked looking out my window at that grove (which wasn't really a grove, being more like seven trees in the forest that formed a rather small circle inside which there were no other trees), I had a rough idea of the trees that could have been the one that fell. After about a minute, going though the possibilities and considering the orientation, color, and size of the tree, I realized that it was in fact one of the trees from the grove. Then I noticed that since the tree had destroyed the wall, and though the sun had not risen yet there was enough light to see by, I could have just followed the tree back though the forest and found where its base was. Doing so, I found that, as I thought, the tree was indeed from the grove. "How stupid I am for not having checked that first," I though. "Or perhaps I'm just still sleepy." Then I realized that I should be focusing on the fact that one of the seven trees of the grove fell, and then tried to figure out precisely how bad that was.

At this point, enough time had passed that other people, having been woken up by the noise of the tree falling, had started to come to the scene. In response to people's concern, I told everyone that I was not hurt, just a bit shocked (which was indeed true). It was fairly clear to everyone that there was not that much that both could and needed to be done immediately. Aren, the leader of the monastery, announced that things would generally go on as usual, the monastery elders would meet during the day, and at the end of the day they would announce what the response would be. The only immediate action he took was to offer me one of the guest rooms (which were on the second floor) for me to sleep in and put my possessions in until the repairs were finished, an offer which I of course took. Everyone went back to their rooms, happy that no one was hurt and that the issue was localized and no longer dangerous but unhappy that one of the trees of the grove had fallen.

The guest room faced west, opposite to my room, which faced east. Unlike my old room, which faced the forest directly, the guest room thus faced a clearing, which contained a small farm for producing those types of food which could not be gathered from nature, and was large enough that one could see, poking over the trees on the other side of the clearing, Mount Erci, a beautiful lone ice-topped mountain in the distance {yes, this is possible as an isolated extinct volcano, though it is rare; Mount Kilimanjaro is a real-world example}. Other than the view, it was much like my room had been, though without as much in it.

I started to look for my stuff among what had fallen and to take it upstairs. This was comparatively easy for a variety of reasons. Though my window had broken, the glass from it {yes, I know glass windows became generally common only a few centuries ago, but don't complain about historical inaccuracy; the setting is medieval but with some modern things which have no especially good reason to not exist} was all in one area, and could generally be avoided without too much difficulty. The only other thing that broke was my bookcase, which while taking up my books I tried (and largely, though not completely, succeeded) to avoid getting splinters from. A few things were crushed by the tree, but not many, and not the really important ones. The guest room had a bed, table, and chest of drawers {remember what I said about not complaining}, which were the only things which would have been too large for me to carry. This task of moving things, however, occupied me for a few hours, and when I was done, it was time for breakfast.

I went to the dining hall and took my share of the food. Apparently what was being served today was a new variation on oatmeal I vaguely remembered Tarnas proposing to make. His idea, which I think he had heard from someone traveling through, was, generally speaking, instead of boiling the combination of oats and milk, to stir it and refrigerate it overnight. {Really, stop complaining. Ice pits have been a thing for a long time, and there's an ice-topped mountain close enough to be visible.} He voluntarily did a large share of the work at the monastery farm, which very few people really wanted to do and which was generally assigned to people on specific days. In addition, due to the farm producing a lot of the ingredients, he also did some of the food preparation. Due to these facts, we were willing to let him try to make the new oatmeal variation, but I, at least, upon eating it, didn't think it was that great, though it wasn't terrible either. {I, the narrator, have not done this and don't really like oatmeal in general that much. As a general rule, don't attribute attitudes from characters to me.}

As I was eating, I overheard a lot of discussion about the tree falling and what the response would be. It was, of course, generally agreed that the damage to the building would be repaired, but it was unclear what would happen to the site of the tree. Would nothing happen, and the Circle Grove only have six trees? Would a seedling be transplanted? Would a whole tree be transplanted? (This was viewed as unlikely unless someone managed to do it via powerful magic, which was uncommon in this part of the world.) There was also a small amount of discussion about whether the fall was fully coincidence. There had not been a storm or strong winds last night, but on the other hand the tree was getting old, and why would anyone have wanted it to collapse? Many people planned to go to the site of the Circle Grove and look at the damage for themselves, which was of course rather easy since it was so close.

After finishing breakfast, I had been assigned farm duty for the morning, but given the circumstance I thought it was reasonable to take a quick peek at the Circle Grove first. I could have, of course, done this previously (the Circle Grove being only about 100 feet away), but I was sufficiently preoccupied with moving my possessions that I wasn't then thinking about looking at the Circle Grove up close. There were some other people there looking at the fallen tree, but the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery had only 68 people (not a special number, simply how many people happened to live in the monastery at the time), only about 20 were actually there looking at the fallen tree, and we weren't crowding in too close, so the view wasn't obstructed. The roots of the fallen tree were showing, and it seemed to have fallen down randomly rather than due to someone undermining it. All the other trees, fortunately, seemed fine; the tree that fell was the one closest to the monastery building, and so did not fall onto or between any of the others. Having seen the situation up close, I left the Circle Grove and headed to the farm.

When I reached the farm, I saw Tarnas there, feeding the cows. "How did you think the new type of oats were?" he asked me. "To be honest, they were okay but not great," I replied. "They weren't quite as good as I expected, either," Tarnas said. "I think it was worth trying them, but I'm probably not going to make them again." "That seems reasonable, and I'm glad we tried them. What farm work should I do?" I asked. "Well, I'm feeding the cows and am going to move on to the chickens, so you can weed one of the unweeded parts of the field and water the crops, unless you'd rather handle the chickens," Tarnas replied. I felt that this plan was (somewhat literally) giving me the dirty work, but since Tarnas was already dealing with the animals, it seemed to make sense for him to take care of the chickens, so I agreed to weed and water the crops.

The tending of the crops was fairly uneventful; I first looked among a certain area of the crops and uprooted the weeds in that area, then took a few buckets of water from the nearby stream (not as close as the grove and farm, but still close) and poured them on the field. When I was done, it had been a few hours, and my farming duty for the day was done. I told Tarnas which area I had weeded and left the farm. {I'm not a farmer; if you are, you can (but shouldn't feel obligated to) improve this and the prior paragraph and give me the improved version.}

During the afternoon I wandered in the woods, which was, unsurprisingly, a common activity among those in the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery. Not much of significance happened. I saw a tree with very bent branches, a few deer, a rabbit; all of these were usual sights in the area. When the sun became low, I headed back to the monastery building.

It turned out that when I got back, Aren was in the main hall, which was where I entered, and he was about to announce the details of the response to the tree falling. Almost everyone was there, except a few people which were presumably out in the forest like I had been. After a few minutes, Aren began to talk. He said the following: "Firstly, we are all, though happy that no one was killed by the tree collapse, unhappy that Brian's room was destroyed by it. We will repair the damage to that area as soon as possible, and Brian has been given a guest room in the meantime. Secondly, we have concluded that the tree fell merely because it was getting old, and there was no intent either to knock down a tree from the Circle Grove or to hurt anyone in particular. Thirdly, although we may want to consider the spiritual implications of a tree from the Circle Grove, which is the cause of the existence of this monastery, falling, the tree fall ultimately does not have that much importance; one could take it as a sign of doom, but it seems more probable that it is simply the fall of a tree, especially since it would have to be a rather small doom to knock down only one of seven trees. Although there have been mystical analyses of the meaning of there being seven trees in the Circle Grove, there probably could be analyses showing the exact same things with six. Thus, we feel no need to replace the tree. We will let new seedlings grow in the place where the tree fell, and eventually one of them may be a new part of the Circle Grove." The speech was done. The main thing people seemed to be talking about afterwards was the potential for doom, which Aren, according to many of the people there, did not do enough to show the unlikelihood of. I personally though that reading doom into a tree collapse was going overboard, and that the monastery was going to be fine. After a few minutes of listening to this discussion that I considered unimportant, I went upstairs to my new temporary room, entered my bed, and fell asleep.

{To avoid confusion, I will say that the viewpoint character of this chapter is not the same as that of the previous chapter. In fact, the viewpoint character of a chapter is never the same as that of the previous chapter. Also, this chapter, like some others, is divided into sections (in this case, two sections). Some future chapters will also have subsections of some of the sections.}

### 2.1.

My story starts in Kaze, where I was born. Like most people from Kaze, I was from a family of farmers, but, also like most people from Kaze, I had been taught the stories of the ancient wars and adventures of Trakhathra, the land to the west. In Kaze, it was well known that nothing ever happened in Kaze itself, but Trakhathra, to the west, was known as a land of danger, a land of war, a land where the most important thing that happened in a typical year was not that the wheat was harvested a week earlier or later than usual.

As I was growing up, I slowly realized that the farming life typical in Kaze was not for me, and started to think about going off to adventure in Trakhathra. This was rare among people in Kaze, but sometimes done. Usually the person going on an adventure either returned fairly quickly, having changed their mind, or was never seen again. Thus, when I was 18 and told my parents that I wanted to go adventure, they denied my request, claiming that they wanted me to stay, that I was needed at the farm, and that I would probably die. I found none of these reasons that compelling, and considered some of them false. Thus, a few days later, I secretly left during the night with nothing but the clothes I was wearing, and set out to the west.

When the sun rose, I had already passed through quite a few farms, but I was still among neighbors (if not next-door neighbors). I didn't want someone who knew me to see me and wonder what I was doing, so I continued on, trying to go quickly and hide in the fields as much as possible. Eventually, the end of the day came, by which point I was rather tired and hungry. Fortunately, by that time I had reached areas with people I did not know (who would thus not worry about what I was doing), and strangers in Kaze generally had guest rooms and would take in travelers for the night. (The level of hospitality in Kaze was, I had heard, remarkably high compared to anywhere else.) I thus went to a nearby house, said that I was taking a trip though Kaze (which was true, though, to avoid worry and additional questions, I omitted the fact that I was ultimately going to Trakhathra), and was given dinner and allowed to stay. Next morning, after having breakfast, I set out west again. I continued to travel in this way, with no adventures, until I reached Trakhathra.

When I entered Trakhathra, my dynamic of travel changed. The landscape was more mountainous, people were clustered in towns rather than scattered in farms, and there was a sense of adventure in the air. Most importantly to me, however, people were much less friendly to strangers. Initially, almost no one would let me stay overnight in their house. However, I quickly found out that my skills of telling stories and playing the horn (I had not brought my horn from home, but some people had one that I could use), which were very common in Kaze, were highly valued in Trakhathra. As long as I made sure to say that I would be willing to provide entertainment, I could more or less get in anywhere. Indeed, once I figured out the value of stories, when I stayed in a county capitol for the night (which I did quite a few times) I usually first went to the palace of the county noble and was allowed in. However, despite my always making sure to ask, it appeared that there were currently no wars, dangerous monsters, powerful artifacts (that someone didn't already have), or other openings for adventure. I started to despair of my chances of finding a part of Trakhathra which still had true adventure.

One day, as the sun was getting low in the sky, I arrived in the town of Northern Springs, about halfway through Trakhathra. I noticed that Northern Springs was a large town, and indeed that it was the capitol of the county it was in. As usual, I went to the palace of the noble of the county, asked whether I could have a meal and stay for a night, and was allowed in. After dinner (which was steak with chili sauce and peaches, much more luxurious than the simple bread and stew I was used to in Kaze) {don't complain about anachronistic usage of meal names, or for that matter anachronistic foods} I told some of the stories I knew. The stories prompted Irari, the noble of the county, to tell the county's own recent history, which mostly seemed to consist of minor skirmishes with the neighboring counties (which, it seemed, were always mostly resolved in a few months, and had not occurred for a few years) and the metals that had been found in the nearby mountains (the county was in fact called Mountain Creek, though the creek itself did not seem as important in the county's history as the mountains).

It was interesting, I though, how the stories I told had themselves, for the most part, come long ago to Kaze, where I heard them, from Trakhathra, but had only been recorded in Kaze and were generally not known to those who I was telling them to. It was also interesting (though, of course, I did not say this) how the recent history of Trakhathra seemed almost as boring as that of Kaze when compared to the ancient stories I told. The recent history of Mountain Creek was fairly typical among what I had heard of the recent history of Trakhathra; indeed, the skirmishes seemed worse than what had been going on in other areas. In fact, I had stayed the previous night in Aura, the county seat of Ipson, which was one of the counties Irari said Mountain Creek had recently fought with. There the fighting had been explained as basically just a few rogue Ipson knights going off to Mountain Creek and wreaking havoc, and it sounded less severe than even Irari's description. I wondered which version of the story was more accurate, but thought that neither was really that likely to lead to adventure for me, especially since the incident was many years old.

As usual, after eating and telling stories, I went to a guest room of the palace and fell asleep. During the night, I woke up due to some noises. But the noises went away after a few minutes, so I did not worry about them further and went back to sleep.

### 2.2.

I woke up from the knocking on the door of my room. It was not the quiet knocking of someone who would like to get your attention but doesn't really care that much. It was the loud knocking of someone who needs to get in for some reason and is likely going to break down the door if nothing happens. Opening the door is generally a good idea in such a situation, but in this specific situation, due to circumstances, it seemed to be even a better idea than usual.

There are rather understandable reasons why the circumstances would make me want to open the door. Firstly, I was a guest, and as a guest it is polite to let the host (who is presumed to be the one knocking) in. Secondly, my host was the Mountain Creek government, and Trakhathrans are known to be quick to anger. I thus didn't want to anger the Mountain Creek government, since doing so could, if news traveled faster than me, lead to very bad things happening to me during the rest of my travels, if there would even be a rest of my travels in that case. I knew that even though Trakhathra was divided into counties which sometimes fight, they were generally united and will cooperate when needed. Thirdly, I didn't really care whether someone wanted me out or not, since I was leaving anyway. Thus, I opened the door.

Someone who I recognized from dinner as Lis, who had been introduced to me as the "Implementor of Justice," was on the other side. She said to me, "You have been accused of stealing the Golden Crown of Power by Exalted Noble Irari and will be taken to speak with her about your crime. Follow me." I realized that this was the rare and unpredictable case where opening the door was likely not a good idea. I was weaponless, and Lis was holding a sword, so I came out and followed her through the palace.

As I was walking, I decided to say that I was innocent (as I of course indeed was), since I thought that it would be unlikely that Lis or Irari would consider me any more likely guilty for making such a declaration, and that if they would do something like that, they would probably just pronounce me guilty no matter what I did. Thus, I said "I didn't steal the Golden Crown of Power. Until Irari mentioned it at dinner last night, I didn't even know it existed." Lis did not respond at all. I realized that there wasn't that much else I could do, and so I continued following.

After a few minutes, we arrived at the throne room and stopped at the front of it. I had not been in a throne room previously in my trip, but I knew the typical design of throne rooms in Trakhathra in the ancient stories. This throne room was in some ways similar to those in the stories, but in many ways different. It was similar in its large size and the presence of a metal throne at the back, with at least some gold and silver in the throne's construction. It was different in the presence of additional chairs both in the back of the room near the throne and in the front, the throne's lack of sophistication (it did not have gemstones in it, as many of the ancient Trakhathran thrones were said to), and the lack of other decoration (apart from some decorative designs on the walls and a not-that-ornate chandelier with a golden chain) in the room itself. I wondered which of these differences were due to stylistic change over time and which were due to this being only the capitol of what seemed like a not-especially important county.

"You can sit down if you want," Lis said, sitting down herself as she spoke. I, of course, also sat down. Looking in more detail at the back of the throne room, I saw there were actually two people there. One was Irari, sitting on the throne. The other, however, was facing Irari, and I could thus not see her face.

"Who is that?" I asked Lis. Lis replied, "Oh, she's a Fire monk. She arrived here last night. Do you have any idea who she is?" "No," I said, "but I woke up in the middle of the night due to noise. Perhaps that was due to her?" "I see," Lis said. "She snuck out to steal the Crown, and you woke up from the noise of her coming and going. Thank you for that evidence." I felt that that was a big step to take; I generally thought well of people, and didn't want someone to be condemned based on some noise of more or less completely unknown cause. Thus, I tried to remedy the situation.

"I didn't see her last night. When did she come?" I asked. "Oh, at about midnight. We put her in the room next to you," Lis said. "In that case, isn't it possible that I heard her getting into the room, not her leaving to-" I tried to explain. "Don't try to make excuses for her," Lis responded. "At this point, I think you two might have cooperated." I realized that in this circumstance it was probably best to keep silent, so I did.

Having nothing else to do, I started to wonder what god, or at least type of god, the Fire monk worshipped. I realized that if I asked Lis, she'd probably interpret it as part of a plan to call upon that god to rain fire down upon all of Mountain Creek, so I remained silent and allowed myself to merely enumerate the possibilities. "All gods can be considered Air gods or Fire gods, or, as some would say, good gods or evil gods. There are three types of Fire god." At least, that was the first few lines of a book {which, apparently, either used "god" gender-neutrally or was biased} I had read in Kaze, though we did not worship gods there {the current first-person character also apparently either uses "god" gender-neutrally, is biased, or is just copying usage from the book they read}, and so my knowledge was all from the west (perhaps even from where I was now), and mostly rather old. I wondered if the classification system I had learned was still being used in the west, or whether it had ever been used in the west as opposed to made up centuries ago by someone in Kaze and added to the ancient texts since it seemed cool. For that matter, I realized, I should be wondering the same things about the stories I had heard of Trakhathran throne rooms, or the stories of ancient adventures.

The first type of Fire god, I remembered, is the death type. This type is usually interested in death, blood, and other such things. Trakhathra was a kingdom with a lot of fighting, so, of all the gods, this type of god generally had the best relation with Trakhathra. Thus, all else being equal, I expected that the visiting Fire monk was a follower of this type of god. There's a smaller type, generally grouped with this first type, consisting of those gods whose followers steal and sneak around in the shadows; if the Fire monk were a follower of such a god, it would make sense that she could have and would have taken the Golden Crown of Power. In another circumstance, I might have assumed that Irari suspecting the Fire monk meant she was more likely to be of this stealing type, but since Irari apparently suspected me for no apparent reason other than that I was a guest, I rejected that assumption.

!version=!safe The second i​s the wireheading type. This type creates experiences so pleasurable that those who enter (almost) nev​er lea​ve; being in such an exper​ience is k​nown as wireheading.​ This type mig​ht not seem i​nt​rinsically evil, but th​eir followers are in fact generally as reviled as those of the death gods, since falling into their pleasu​res is generally considered a fate as b​ad as death due to the fact that it (often? usually? it depends on the god) stops you from ever accomplishing any of your other plans.​ Some of the Ai​r go​ds are also into wireheading, but the followers of Air gods usually wirehead simply and in peace and don't really try to cause others to, whereas the followers of Fire gods wirehead in complicated ways and will often come out and put the trace of their pleasures on the outside world to try to lure people in, sometimes subtly, sometimes not: it all depends on the god. Like much of the world, Trakhathra would not likely let a follower of such a god in. Thus, I did not expect the Fire monk to be a follower of a god of this type.

!version=safe This paragraph has been censored for safety reasons.

The third type is the miscellaneous, not-really-evil type. This contains a lot of somewhat neutral gods of various types, which it is impossible to enumerate. It was possible that the Fire monk was a follower of a god of this type.

{Sorry that you had to deliver that long exposition.} Who are you? {I'm the narrator. You're in a story.} What??? Why are you talking to me? Is Lis hearing this? {Calm down a bit. I'm talking to you because you also tell stories and so it seemed appropriate. Also in general I don't like subjecting characters to endless self-given exposition, even if sometimes it's necessary. No, Lis isn't hearing this. This paragraph is just between you and me.} That's good. Are you going to keep talking to me in the future? {Maybe. I'd advise not worrying about it. In fact, I'd prefer if you didn't even act like this was a story and kept my existence to yourself.} That's fine. Bye for now.

Suddenly, I saw that while I was lost in thought, Irari and the Fire monk had gotten up from their chairs at the other side of the throne room and had almost reached us. I wondered whether this meant I would talk to Irari next, and also whether the Fire monk had been found to be guilty or innocent. As it turns out, I didn't have to wait to find out; when Irari reached us, she said "I am banishing both of the visitors due to-". "Due to something that there's no need to explain right now," the Fire monk said. Then, after a brief pause (during which I thought about how bold it was to interrupt someone who had just severely punished you and could punish you more severely if they chose), the Fire monk turned to me.

## 3.

!version=!no_code {Note: This chapter has some code, though sections 1, 2, 3 and 6 are mostly code-free. There is a guide to the language used at the end, in the supplemental material. After this chapter, the story will return to its regularly scheduled non-programming.}

!version=no_code {Note: This chapter has some code, but since you're reading the version without code you shouldn't see it.}

{Another note, on a somewhat different topic: This chapter's viewpoint character has a style of narration with lots of lists and digressions (even more than in previous chapters), which is similar to my preferred style. In some sense, this is a story, so the similarity is not a coincidence. Indeed, this chapter's viewpoint character is the character I identify with most, which is probably a bad sign (both due to the characteristics it implies that I have and the fact that I'm putting in a character like me). In any case, I don't plan to interrupt that much.}

### 3.1.

#### 3.1.1

The sun was setting behind the mountains. The sunset was undeniably beautiful, but to me it was another annoyance to add to the list of annoyances that had befallen me on my journey north.

{The viewpoint character isn't going to explain geography right now, even though they'll be dealing with it to a certain extent, but fortunately they were willing to explain geography at a later time. (Should I have said "will be willing"? For me as the narrator, in-story time is confusing.) The explanation is at the end.}

I wondered, as I had wondered so many times in the past, why in the world the FP Conference (which is where I was going) was even placed in Trakhathra this year. {To avoid suspense and confusion, I will say that "FP" here means "functional programming." I had to interrupt here for clarity, since I don't think this meaning was going to get mentioned otherwise.} In the past it had been in Gerenda, which had been fine for me. Gerenda was, indeed, somewhat further from Tumlunra, where I lived. However, unlike the walk to Trakhathra, the walk to Gerenda was nice and not too cold. Also, the population of Gerenda was friendly to me, at least once they saw I wasn't going to kill or wirehead them. {"wirehead" can also be used transitively to mean "cause someone to wirehead". As before, I had to interrupt.}

By contrast, the xenophobia throughout Trakhathra meant that I had to rely on those who wanted support from Imbriel, my goddess. My best-case scenario was the following. Firstly, I would go to a random house which still seemed lit (I didn't want to bother anyone who was asleep) and knock. Secondly, the inhabitants (or inhabitant) would say "Who are you? What do you want?" Thirdly, I would say that if they let me stay overnight, my goddess would bless them. Fourthly, they would grudgingly accept this and I would stay overnight.

That, as I said, was the best-case option. There were two ways it could go wrong. The first was the door being slammed in my face as soon as the inhabitants of the house saw that it wasn't someone they knew, or the door just not being opened in the first place. This happened often, and after it happened I just went to another house. The second was people not wanting to take me in overnight just for the blessings of my goddess. This was understandable; Imbriel was not that powerful as divine beings go, especially in practical ways. The most I could offer was a type of small light which did not require fire or wood, (limited) protection against fire, and a few illusions (which were, apparently, considered valuable by Trakhathrans during warfare). The first two items on this list were common among Fire deities, and thus, even though there were no native deities in Trakhathra and thus many people did not worship any particular deity, many people already had those two items in some way or another, often from travelers like me. Also, many people, not seeing an immediate advantage to the ability to create illusions, were not interested. Thus, occasionally I was not able to stay in anyone's house overnight and had to sleep outside. I had brought some camping equipment (and I was able to gather some food from nature), but it was cold compared to Tumlunra. (In Tumlunra, sleeping outside would have been a reasonable option, and indeed at the start of my journey I slept outside quite a lot.)

My thoughts drifted to another problem I had with Trakhathra, namely that I hated the feudalism that could be seen throughout. The whole vast power hierarchy of ordinary people serving nobles, who themselves served the ruler, probably with additional levels that I didn't really even want to hear about, was foreign to me. In Tumlunra, everyone was regarded as equal, there were no leaders, and people chose their own tasks. It somehow fortunately happened that what needed to be done was done. This situation also meant that I could easily head up north to the FP Conference and no one would stop me. Indeed, it was generally agreed that all else being equal, somebody should go. We did a lot of programming in Tumlunra, after all, and in every prior year since who-knows-when some of us had gone to the FP Conference. Since I wanted to go anyway, I said I would go, and for some reason (maybe the location) no one else wanted to. So I was going alone.

I suddenly remembered why I had felt that the sun setting behind the mountains was a problem. The reason was that, according to what I had heard in the last town, the next town on my journey was still quite a few miles further. I considered setting up camp where I was, but I decided not to. I created a small light to see by (since it was getting dark quickly) and kept going.

I kept walking until what seemed to be roughly midnight, at which point it was significantly colder than it had been at sunset, due to both my altitude increasing and the night continuing. At that time, I reached the next town and walked through it looking for a good house to try to stay in. To my dismay, on the first few streets I walked through everyone seemed to be asleep (that is, all the lights were off), and I did not want to bother anyone by waking them up. After walking around a little, I stumbled across a palace, and I realized that this town was a county capitol and the palace was that of the county noble. The palace was not lit inside, but it still had a guard holding a torch in front of the door, who, I realized, could easily see me due to the light I had. "Who are you? Where are you from? Why are you walking around in the middle of the night?" the guard asked me. I realized that perhaps I could stay in the palace, and indeed that there did not seem to be anywhere else for me to stay. I thus answered, "My name is Siara. I am a follower of the Fire deity Imbriel, a goddess of the moon, and I have come from the south. I am journeying north for a conference, and I am out so late since I am looking for somewhere to stay. If you would be so kind as to let me stay overnight, I would be grateful and Imbriel will give you her blessings. I hope that I will be allowed to stay." And I very much did.

"What would we want from Imbriel?" the guard asked me. "That light you have is just a useless trinket; we would need something more powerful." "How about automated farming techniques?" I replied. To be honest, although I knew a bit about programming, all I knew about automated farming was a vaguely-remembered solution to the idealized problem of traversing a field, which gave a direction to move in given the size of the field and a time:

!version=!no_code (x y time -> d (<| 0) (|> (d (|> (|> 0)) (<| (d (|> 0) (<| 0) (<= y (% time (* 2 y))))) (% (s time) y))) (< time (* x y)))

!version=no_code Code has been censored due to being code.

I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if this solution had an off-by-one error, but more importantly I thought that traversing a field was a very small part of farming and that thus this would not be that helpful. I knew that we had farmers in Tumlunra, so this type of thing clearly couldn't be sufficient for full automation. However, the midnight air was cold, I was high up, I didn't want to stay outside, and this was the first thing I thought of that might remotely seem worthwhile to a noble. Although I wasn't really sure of the value of farming in Trakhathra, I had seem many farms and stayed with a few farmers on my travels, and I presumed that, as in most places, farming was rather important and automating it would be considered valuable. In any case, the guard said "That will do," and took me to a guest room in the palace, in which I soon fell asleep.

I woke up from the knocking on the door of my room. I, of course, didn't want to further inconvenience whoever wanted to get my attention, so I opened the door. The person on the other side did not look happy at all. She said to me "Having stolen Exalted Noble Irari's Golden Crown of Power, you will be punished accordingly. Follow me."

I responded "As far as I know, I didn't steal the Golden Crown of Power. What reason do you have to believe I did?" She said "It went missing, so someone must have stolen it." This leap of logic is clearly rather large. In Tumlunra, when someone made a leap of logic like this, they would often not be corrected by whoever they were talking to, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it was likely that they would catch the mistake themselves a few seconds later, saying "Wait. That doesn't make sense." and then either explaining further and more logically or giving up and acknowledging that they hadn't yet shown whatever they were trying to show. Secondly, it abused their intelligence to point out such a fundamental error. Thirdly, when people were dealing with important matters, they would generally be more careful, and thus such leaps would most often be made in unimportant situations.

As an example of this third point, once I was hiking around with someone and we saw a well-hidden canyon a few minute's walk away. We then spent half an hour trying to figure out whether going to the canyon was worthwhile. About halfway through that conversation, one of us (I just remember what was said, not who said it) said (something with roughly the meaning of) "It would have been quicker to just go to the canyon." Then the other pointed out "That's true, and it intuitively seems that we should thus have just gone, but at this point our discussion is a sunk cost." The discussion only ended when one of us said "Canyons are among the most majestic sights in nature, so going to this one is surely a wise idea." Of course, just because some canyons are wonderful sights doesn't mean they all are, and this one was indeed somewhat disappointing. But at that point we both just wanted an excuse to decide, so there were no objections to the faulty logic. As a side note to the side note, when we were at the canyon we figured out that, since we had no reason to believe that our conversation would go any differently than it had been going, we should probably have just gone to the canyon earlier, since at a certain point the expected remaining time of the conversation became greater than the time to go to the canyon and back.

In any case, often in Tumlunra leaps of logic were not corrected, and for good reason. However, in this case only one of the three above motivations for not making a correction applied; it did not seem that the logical mistake would be corrected otherwise, and the issue at hand was, at least to me, rather important. I felt that abusing the intelligence of the person I was talking to was worth it in this case, so I said "Perhaps someone else stole it, or it just fell behind something." She gave the reply "Don't try to give excuses." I did not persist in my objection, realizing that I was very unlikely to succeed, and thus simply followed.

To my mild surprise, after a few minutes we arrived at the throne room, and we went to the back of it, where the noble of the area (she was Irari, I presumed) was sitting on her throne with a (probably backup) silver crown. I was somewhat expecting to go to prison directly, but apparently there was to be some semblance of due process. The person who I had followed to the throne room left, and I was then alone with Irari.

#### 3.1.2

Irari said "Sit," pointing to a chair facing the throne. I, of course, sat. It was strange, I thought, that I would be offered a chair, given that my main example of this area's treatment of people was its considering them guilty of crimes for reasons that were highly dubious at best. However, I soon realized that if I had not had a chair, I would have remained standing, which, since the throne was not that high, would have put me in a higher position than Irari. In any case, trying to figure out the exact combination of motivations and counter-motivations that led to me getting offered a chair did not actually seem that useful in the situation I was in.

Irari did not say anything further immediately, and there was a silence as I tried to figure out what I should do. I eventually said, "I have been told I was accused of stealing the Golden Crown of Power. I did not. Indeed, apart from my being a visitor, I see no reason to believe that I stole it, as opposed to someone else stealing it or it somehow disappearing. I would be happy to let you search my guest room or to assist you in finding the Golden Crown of Power in any other way. If there is some reason for the worry that I in particular stole it, I would appreciate hearing that reason so that I can try to counter it." "You are from the south; that is reason enough for suspecting you. We will indeed search your room, but there will be no need for your help." Irari replied.

Concerning the first part of Irari's response (which seemed to be the more important part for me to address), the type of discrimination in it usually didn't happen when I visited Gerenda, but I had learned that it was common in other areas. Indeed, though Tumlunra was indeed part of Azira (Azira was the region that "the south" referred to in this context), it was not one of the parts of Azira that Trakhathra had great relations with. However, it seemed to me that Irari was assuming that I was from one of the parts of Azira known for stealing, and in fact Tumlunra was not one of those parts. I tried to correct the misconception. "I am not a thief." I said. "It is true that I am from the south, but I am from Tumlunra, which is not known for stealing." "Why should I believe you?" Irari replied.

I realized that I had no good answer. I showed Irari some coins from Tumlunra that I still had, but she (correctly) pointed out that anyone could get some of those without too much effort. I then responded, "I can't show that I'm from Tumlunra or that I didn't steal the Golden Crown of Power. However, in what cases would I have been able to show these things? What evidence beyond my word can you expect?" In Tumlunra, this type of issue did not occur that often, and indeed, usually when something was missing, no one accused anyone else of taking it and someone found it in some unexpected place at some point in the next few days, or occasionally longer. Also, doors usually had locks, there were magical safes for storing valuable items, and we had special housing for visitors. I was not prepared for this type of accusation, and wondered whether, if I were in Irari's place, I would not suspect myself.

"Your word is not sufficient evidence. You can't show that you're innocent, so you're probably guilty." Irari responded. I realized that even if I were in Irari's place and did suspect myself, I would at least have said something with more tact and fewer arguments against it. Perhaps I would say "You are still a major suspect due to me not knowing you. Thus you are required to stay until the Crown is found." Back outside of the hypothetical, Irari continued, "Or that other person staying here is, but probably not, since he's from Kaze and people from there would never dare to do anything so bold. He probably wouldn't touch the Golden Crown of Power even if I commanded him to."

I was not previously aware of the presence of another visitor, probably since they arrived earlier in the evening than I did, or even perhaps on a previous day. I wondered whether the other visitor would be as resentful of Irari's stereotype of residents of Kaze as timid as I was of her stereotype of residents of Azira as thieves. In any case, I saw that despite the presence of this other visitor, I was still by far the main suspect under consideration. I thus resorted to the reason I was allowed to stay in the first place. "You know, I was allowed to stay here due to promising help from Imbriel, a goddess of the moon, trickery, and surprise," I said. "I was told," Irari replied.

"So, Imbriel knows I didn't take the Golden Crown of Power, and, unless you let me leave with my possessions without giving any punishment and you don't hinder or bother me after I leave, she will probably plague you with additional things getting lost." I said. I knew that just saying "unless you let me leave" would be shorter and more elegant than the four conditions I gave, but I felt that otherwise Irari would not let me take my camping equipment, or would send someone with me when I left, or would imprison me for a week (which would make me miss the FP conference) and only then let me free. I wanted

"What does that prove? She's a goddess of theft! She'd help you and punish us whether or not if you took the Golden Crown of Power!" Irari replied. "No, if you were listening, I said she was a goddess of trickery and surprise, not theft. She's more into tame types of surprise than "Where did this thing go?" surprise (though she does that on occasion when it's appropriate). For example, did you know you can form decrement in the typed lambda calculus with numbers, increment, and repeated function application?" I further explained. "What does that mean?" said Irari, who, based on her reaction, I realized could probably not tell a lambda from a kappa (not just the letter kappa, but the type of mythological kappa that lives in streams and likes cucumbers).

"I'd be happy to explain it," I said. "But first, where's your backup silver crown?" I asked this because I'd noticed that Irari's crown had somehow disappeared from her head at some point during the conversation. Just after I asked, I realized that, though I had asked the question out of a strong instinct to always make sure people didn't lose things (having myself accidentally dropped and lost things on walks through Tumlunra too many times), it would be taken as an admission of responsibility for the backup silver crown's disappearance. I then realized that, indeed, Imbriel had probably caused the crown to disappear, and I was indirectly responsible.

Since I was generally in a precarious situation, and I had just said that Imbriel generally did not make things disappear, I wasn't sure that making the silver crown disappear was a good decision by Imbriel (insofar as it was a decision; Imbriel, like many gods and goddesses, did many things on autopilot that we humans would only do after thinking about it). I certainly hadn't asked her to do that. But I realized that it was indeed a good idea; quite probably, Irari didn't really care whether or not I'd stolen the Golden Crown of Power, but instead she mostly cared about how much trouble she'd get if she didn't let me free and how it balanced against any pleasure there might be in imprisoning someone. Causing any type of trouble for her, then, swung the mental calculus in the direction favorable to me.

Letting my mind turn back to the situation at hand, I saw Irari looking around for her backup silver crown and, fairly quickly, finding it behind the throne (apparently; I couldn't see behind the throne from my position). She looked angry, but apparently she was maintaining enough composure to not say anything immediately. And indeed, she waited to speak until she sat back down. At that point, she said "I see. Your evil goddess is making crowns in this palace move around. We will rectify this situation by finding the Golden Crown of Power, and permanently banishing you from our county so that your goddess cannot continue in this path."

I thought this was one of the better things (for Irari) she could have said given the situation. Irari could have imprisoned me (or even killed me), but she realized that that would cause lots of trouble from Imbriel. She could have blamed the problem on nature rather than Imbriel, but that would have been too nice. She could have acknowledged that there was no way to stop Imbriel from causing trouble, but that would have made her seem weak for not being able to do anything against Imbriel. Instead of doing any of those things, she blamed Imbriel (and, indirectly, me), and furthermore made it clear that she was powerful enough to avoid any consequences from me and Imbriel. As a nice touch, the proposed solution was, more or less, for me to do just what I had planned (though I would need to take a different route back), making it unlikely that I or Imbriel would complain. Never mind that, in all likelihood, Imbriel cared about the situation enough that, if she wanted to, she would find it worth the effort to do problematic stuff even without me in Northern Springs; the rhetoric was what was important.

Irari then said, after a pause, "We shall also demand tribute from your goddess. Let her give us a vehicle that tills a field avoiding rocks, or an automatic egg-gatherer that doesn't annoy the hens too much." Apparently, Irari still wanted the technology I had promised so that I would be allowed to stay. "No." I said, somewhat relieved that the situation gave me a good excuse not to explain that I knew almost nothing about automated farming (though I was already considering how to add a rock-location function to my solution). "You have banished me, and my goddess will not help you." Irari, after thinking for a minute (presumably to try to find a good response), said "Thus it shall be. You shall be banished from this land forevermore."

"What about the person from Kaze staying here who you mentioned previously?" I asked. "We shall imprison him," Irari replied. I considered this unfair, since Irari had said that in her opinion, the visitor had not stolen the Golden Crown of Power. "Why?" I asked. "We both know he wasn't responsible. You even admitted it previously." To be honest, I accepted it as a possibility that he was responsible, but I had no reason at all to believe that he was, and I thought that if I said that to Irari, she might well somehow use it against him. Irari replied, "One can never be sure with this type of thing."

I said, "You may be fine with that, but I am not, and I doubt that Imbriel is either. Indeed, I am sure that if your visitor from Kaze did not in fact take the Golden Crown of Power, Imbriel will try to do whatever she can to punish you despite my banishment." To underscore the point, Irari's silver crown again suddenly disappeared, to (as far as I could tell) the same place it had gone to before. When Irari had retrieved it again, she said "How do I know that Imbriel won't try to punish me anyway?" This was a good question; perhaps Irari was somewhat more intelligent than I thought initially. I thought, and finally said, "But if you imprison the visitor from Kaze, his deity will also be easily able to act through him and punish you." "Do people from Kaze even worship deities?" Irari asked.

Indeed, people from Kaze did not generally worship deities. However, I hadn't been sure whether Irari, who I knew likely did not worship a deity herself, knew that they did not, and now I knew that she didn't know. For the sake of the visitor from Kaze, who hopefully would not mind that much given the situation, I said, "Yes, they do. They might not publicly reveal it, but they worship many great and terrible divine beings, some of which are very strange and difficult even to think about." As far as I knew, such great and terrible divine beings mostly existed in fictional stories, and they were definitely not worshipped in Kaze. However, I doubted Irari would know that, and maximizing apparent danger seemed like a good idea.

To give an example, I then said, "For example, Carthn is the entity controlling discussion about Carthn, and gains more power in a place (subject to certain limitations) the more directly it is discussed there. After enough information about it has been presented in a given place, Carthn becomes able to take unbelievably powerful actions." I then realized that, although I did want to give an example, I didn't say that part about Carthn (who I was not previously aware of the idea or existence of); I only heard it. My hope was that Imbriel made up the idea of Carthn and gave the description. The main other possibility that I could think of was that Carthn actually existed and described itself. If that were the case, the mention of strange gods might have pushed this area over some discussion threshold, allowing Carthn to say more and more about itself. Fortunately, there was quiet for some time afterwards.

Irari said, "That sounds bad. Let's not talk about it. The visitor from Kaze shall also be banished to avoid any interference from divine beings of that sort. That being resolved, you shall both leave now." She stood up and started walking back across the throne room, and I followed her.

!version=!no_code As I walked across the throne room, I started thinking further about how to take account of rocks. Could I just do some type of search for the closest unvisited location and then go to it? If I did this, I'd probably want to iterate some step function by the number of steps in time. Clearly, I'd want a set of visited locations, which could be implemented via a two-parameter function with boolean output (as the set of rocks could also be implemented). I'd also want some way of calculating distance and a path: breadth-first search seemed reasonable. I considered how to implement breadth-first search on a 2d-space (I had done this many times before but it wasn't that memorable). I had just decided to model the graph as a function from tuples to lists of tuples when we reached the other side of the throne room. There, two people were standing, one of whom was the person who had taken me to the throne room.

!version=no_code As I walked across the throne room, I started thinking further about how to take account of rocks. {Details are left out since you're reading the version without code.} Soon enough, we reached the other side of the throne room. There, two people were standing, one of whom was the person who had taken me to the throne room.

"I am banishing both of the visitors due to-" Irari said, pointing at me and at the person I had not met, who I thus assumed to be the visitor from Kaze. "Due to something that there's no need to explain right now," I blurted out. "Why did I say that?" I thought to myself (but of course, did not say); I didn't usually interrupt people. I came up with a few possibilities. Perhaps I didn't want to publicly admit the somewhat underhanded technique of threatening that I used. Perhaps I didn't want to risk the person who took me to the throne room complaining and persuading Irari to change her mind about letting me and the other guest go, or to risk her actually, unlike Irari, being aware that people in Kaze did not generally believe in divine beings. Perhaps I didn't want someone to accidentally mention Carthn and potentially make the situation worse. Perhaps I just, at some level, wanted to go as quickly as possible and didn't even want there to be a brief explanation of what happened, though to my conscious self this seemed foolish. Perhaps I wanted to avoid being caught in a conversation so that I could keep thinking about rocks, though this also seemed foolish. In Tumlunra I had been taught to never presume I knew myself (including my motivations), but that didn't stop me from guessing. In any case, after these thoughts I turned to the other guest.

"Hi, my name is Siara. What's yours?" I asked him.

I might even be able to recover some of the things that have already mysteriously disappeared. Of course, if it turns out that some other deity is making these things disappear and additional disappearance force is applied to them, I might not have enough power to help. I'll also try to investigate the reason for the disappearances and see what I can find.]" [And we also have BFS with rocks?] "The egg-gatherer would be nice too," said Irari, somewhat ungratefully. "Well, you can't have everything," I stated.

I headed south, thinking about how to calculate the influence of a list of actions on the annoyance levels of hens.

Like most people, I knew a bit about wizards; not a lot, but a bit. I knew, in particular, that their security was generally designed not to keep everyone out, but only to keep out those who they did not consider worthy to enter, which given typical wizard attitudes meant those who did not have a lot of knowledge in a lot of areas (or sometimes a lot of knowledge in one area, depending on how much the wizard focused their work).

"We're in a story? Let's get out of this situation by asking the narrator for help!" I said. "Yeah! I talked to them once, actually. They didn't seem that enthusiastic about breaking the fourth wall, but let's try it," said Jayden. {Nope. Not going to work.} "That's the narrator, who will surely - wait, did you say no? We're all going to die!" Jayden pleaded. ("Or arguably just go out of existence, depending on how story destruction works," Brian said to himself, though loudly enough that we heard it.) {Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don't really care about you, though Brian had a nice aside there which he should be proud of.} "See, this type of evil is what I need to distinguish myself from!" I said. I realized that the narrator had put me in a position societally considered evil in the first place, and spent a few seconds thinking about how bad this meant that the narrator must be before going back to trying to come up with good arguments to stop the narrator from ending the world.

"But aren't you worried about the Destruction coming out of this universe and invading yours?" Brian asked as I thought. {I'll just take that risk. In my universe that would be rather unprecedented. In any case, I think an alternate ending would ruin the narrative.} "Call me crazy, but I think that our universe ending is not the only satisfactory ending to this story," Jayden said. {It's the ending I'm giving you.} At this point, I had come up with something reasonably convincing, based on some weird dialogs I remembered having read about the epistemic status of the world and to what extent it can be determined. "But maybe you're yourself in a-" I said, but then suddenly stopped. {I think you were going to do some type of simulation-argument type trick there, but unfortunately I can remain blissfully ignorant of that by just not coming up with more dialog for you (even though you're currently the viewpoint character) and not thinking about the issue. In fact, I'm going to ask the readers to ignore the last few paragraphs, and revert to the point where you had the idea of summoning me (which was actually a pretty good idea).}

### Geography

I feel that I should first make it very clear that I'm not a geographer at all; I'm just giving commonly known information. Don't put too much trust in me.

The world, as far as I know, has seven parts, though many others are rumored to exist. A rough map, preserving the topological structure and rough sizes, but not all the curves, some of which are very large, is:

~ represents water, . represents land, |, -, and + separate things (land from water and parts from other parts; the separators don't take up actual space), and numbers represent land (and serve as a key to the map). There are, as you can see if you count carefully, seven regions, each with a mystically (and occasionally practically) associated element. I will now give a brief description of each.

Region 1 is Kaze. It primarily consists of grassland. It is heavily farmed, is moderately populated, and has no overall government, though there are some regional governments without that much power. Its associated element is soil.

Region 2 is Tosari. It primarily consists of mountains, with some high grasslands in between, and some rocky areas without true mountains in the east. It continues north, and it is unknown where or whether it ever ends, and if so what replaces it. It is more civilized than one might expect; it has a distinct culture, said to have come from across the Western Ocean. It is very sparsely populated; people often live alone, and what towns exist are small. It has no government of any type (except for some town governments). Its associated element is stone.

Region 3 is Trakhathra. It primarily consists of mountains, though there are some grasslands and deserts at the boundaries. It is moderately populated. It is divided into a number of counties, each ruled over by a noble. Generally the rule of nobles in Trakhathra is more tight than the rule of the government anywhere else. There is no central government and the nobles often fight. It is known for its wars and its mining industry. Its associated element is metal.

Region 4 is Niraina. It primarily consists of forest, with some grassland in the west. It is unknown how far north and east it extends, and there are rumors of an Eastern Ocean to its east (not to be confused with the Southeastern Ocean shown on the map, though they may connect). It is also unknown what shape and size the northern lake (or perhaps lakes) shown in it in the map are, but their shown location is believed to be roughly correct. There are a few large cities in the west of Niraina, but it is otherwise sparsely populated. There is no central government; there are a lot of towns and small settlements scattered throughout, however, with varying levels of civilization. Niraina's associated element is wood.

Region 5 is Azira. It primarily consists of desert, though there are some areas (especially further south) which actually get enough rain for easy farming. It is unknown how far south it extends, but it is believed to end and be replaced by dense forest somewhere to the south. There are a few large cities, but otherwise Azira is sparsely populated. It is divided into many regions of various sizes, each with a distinct level of civilization and a distinct type of government. Tumlunra, in which I live, is a small region roughly in the north-middle of Azira, not as dry as most of the west. It is (from my perspective; I am of course biased) one of the more civilized areas of Azira. Azira's associated element is fire, and most worshippers of Fire deities live there.

Region 6 is Gerenda. It primarily consists of meadows, but it has all types of ecosystems. It has many large cities, is very civilized, and has a central government. This is generally attributed to the presence of many wizards in Gerenda, though the exact chain of logic in this attribution is not completely clear. The main industries are farming and magic. Its associated element is water.

Region 7 is Aidelaria. It primarily consists of forest and gets a lot of mist and rain. It is generally believed, but not known for sure, that if you go far enough north, the eastern border of Aidelaria meets the ocean. It has a few large cities, but like Niraina it mostly has small settlements without a central government. Its associated element is air, and most worshippers of Air deities live there.

Also, if you're including this description of place, shouldn't you also include a description of time? {That's a good point. Would you be willing to give that too?} Of course. I feel more comfortable with the calendar than with geography, though I'm not sure anyone is fully comfortable with the lunar component of the calendar.

{Here is a description of the calendar.}

### Calendar

The calendar was, according to legend, invented in its own year 6 (though the counting of years has started over several times, so the year 6 that the calendar was invented in was far more than 99 years ago).

The calendar has two components: a solar component and a lunar component.

# Solar Component

In the solar calendar, there are four seasons per year, which are Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall in that order. Each season contains three 30-day months. The months of Winter are Early Winter, Middle Winter, and Late Winter, and the months of other seasons are named analogously.

Between each two seasons there is one day, which is considered to belong to the season after it. The day between Fall and Winter is the Winter Solstice, that between Winter and Spring is the Spring Equinox, that between Spring and Summer is the Summer Solstice, and that between Summer and Fall is the Fall Equinox.

The boundary between years is at the Winter Solstice, which is considered the start of the new year.

Every three solstices or equinoxes, starting with Winter Solstice, 1, there is an extra day added to the solstice or equinox, so the solstice or equinox has two days. For a given solstice or equinox, this thus happens every three years.

Every 11 winter solstices, starting with Winter Solstice, 9, the winter solstice is skipped, so the first day of the year is 1 Early Winter. Every 33 winter solstices, the addition and subtraction of a day cancel out and it is treated as a normal solstice or equinox.

The day is considered to start and end at midnight, though this isn't that important.

The solstices and equinoxes are considered days outside of the ordinary, when different parts of the world, and perhaps even different worlds, touch. On these days people often do things that they would not otherwise do. This tradition surrounding the solstices and equinoxes, it is sometimes said, was started due to the inventor of the calendar, on the evening of the summer solstice, wandering into another realm that they usually tried to avoid, acting there in ways they later regretted, and, the next day, seeking a justification for what had happened. However, what truth or falsehood there may be to this remains unclear.

Some example dates:

1 Spring Equinox, 105 (year 105, the first spring equinox)

2 Spring Equinox, 105 (year 105, the first spring equinox)

1 Early Spring, 105 (year 105, month Early Spring (the first month of spring), day 1)

Summer Solstice, 105 (year 105, the summer solstice)

5 Middle Fall, 105 (year 105, month Middle Fall (the second month of Fall), day 5)

# Lunar Component

Almost no one knows all the rules of the lunar calendar; many people just look at the sky and guess. The lunar calendar isn't actually used for that much, so not knowing the day in it isn't actually a big problem. However, as a follower of Imbriel, with Imbriel being a goddess of the moon, I had to learn the rules. So here they are.

In the lunar calendar, each day has a lunar count. The lunar count of a day is one more than the lunar count of the preceding day, modulo 29. The lunar count of 1 Early Spring, 1 is 8.

However, solstices and equinoxes are skipped in this count. So, more precisely and correctly, the lunar count of a day that is not a solstice or equinox is one more than the lunar count of the preceding day that is not a solstice or equinox, modulo 29. However, solstices and equinoxes are considered to have lunar counts: these counts are simply the average of the counts of the adjacent non-solstice-or-equinox days, considering the average of 28 and 0 to be 28.5 rather than 14.

There are two additional exceptions. If two non-solstice-or-equinox days are separated only by one of the solstices or equinoxes to which a day was added (even if this addition of a day cancelled with the removal of a day), the one after the solstice or equinox is defined to have the same lunar count as the one before. Also, the first non-solstice-or-equinox day of years that are 64 modulo 77 is defined to have a lunar count two greater than the last day of the previous year. Finally, in years that are 64 modulo 231, these effects cancel and the lunar count increases by one, as usual. Note that in year that are 64 modulo 77 and not 64 modulo 231, there is no winter solstice, but the (non-existent) winter solstice is considered to have lunar count one more than the day before it.

We've finished the definition of lunar count of a day. So what do we do with it? Firstly, we number the New Moons (capitalization intentional) of a year. The New Moons of a given year are the maximal streaks of contiguous days, at least one of which is in that year, that all have lunar count 0. 0 can be skipped in one case, the case of years 64 mod 77. In this case, the last day of a year can have lunar count 28, and the first day of the next year (which will be 1 Early Winter) thus would have lunar count 1; the (non-existent) winter solstice is then considered a New Moon, in the new year but not in the old year. Note that a New Moon can be in multiple years, if it includes an existent winter solstice.

The New Moons of a year are numbered, starting from 1 for the first New Moon of the year. Each New Moon has an associated lunar month, defined as the set of days on or after the first day of that New Moon but not on or after the first day of the following New Moon (which may not be a New Moon of the same year). Note that the number of actual days in a lunar month can be 28, 29, 30, 31, or 32 depending on the lunar month. Still, no day is ever labelled with a number higher than 28.

## Notation

From now on, we're looking at almost entirely just notation. Days are generally referred to as, for example:

17 after New Moon 10, 105

That means the day with lunar count 17 in the lunar month of New Moon 10 of year 105.

When referring to the day of the New Moon itself, there is no analogous "0 after". Here is an example:

New Moon 7, 105

That means New Moon 7 of year 105.

### Occurrence disambiguation

If a New Moon has multiple days, or there are otherwise multiple days in the same lunar month with the same lunar count, each one of these days (including the first) is disambiguated with an occurrence number, which is simply the number of days in the same lunar month with the same lunar count on or before that day. Here is an example:

(occurrence 2) 19 after New Moon 3, 105

### Year of new moon

When part of a lunar month is in one year and part is in another, it is always noted what year the New Moon of the lunar month was in, since a lunar month might have days in the year after the year of the New Moon.

20 after New Moon 12 (of 104), 105

This would be a day in year 105, but in a month starting with a New Moon in year 104.

Generally this only occurs with New Moon 12 or 13, but, as noted above, it can also occur with a New Moon on the winter solstice. Since such a New Moon itself is in two years, it is annotated with a number for both years it is in, separated by a slash. The first occurrence:

(occurrence 1) New Moon 13 (of 78) / 1 (of 79), 78

The second occurrence:

(occurrence 2) New Moon 13 (of 78) / 1 (of 79), 79

A few days after that new moon:

5 after New Moon 13 (of 78) / 1 (of 79), 79

Annoyingly, the above means that to write a lunar date, you have to know when the lunar month ends, that is, what its last day is.

### Non-integer lunar counts

If the lunar count is not an integer, it is written as (its floor)/(its ceiling). Here is an example:

24/25 after New Moon 9, 105

There are two special cases. Instead of 28/29, 28/(next new moon tomorrow) is used (and yes, here new moon in "next new moon tomorrow" is lowercase):

28/(next new moon tomorrow) after New Moon 12, 98

And instead of 0/1, (last new moon yesterday)/1 is used:

(last new moon yesterday)/1 after New Moon 7, 103

### Skipped New Moon

It is entirely possible, though extremely rare, for a new New Moon to be skipped due to the every-77-year winter solstice. This would result in going right from 28 after New Moon 13 to 1 after New Moon 1. This New Moon is attributed to the (non-existent) winter solstice. This was all mentioned above. Thus, the New Moon is considered New Moon 1, but no part of it is in the prior year. This being a remarkable occurrence, the new moon is noted as (skipped). Example:

5 after New Moon 1 (skipped), 2990

### Phase of the moon

One can also calculate the phase of the moon if it is desired. The phase of a moon is calculated by taking the number of days after the new moon, dividing by 29, and rounding to the nearest eighth. Depending on the result, the phase is:

0: new moon

1/8: waxing crescent moon

1/4: first-quarter moon

3/8: waxing gibbous moon

1/2: full moon

5/8: waning gibbous moon

3/4: third-quarter moon

7/8: waning crescent moon

1: new moon

Note that the new moon phase generally extends one day before and after the New Moon.

An example of a full date with everything together is:

10 Early Spring, 28 after New Moon 3, new moon, 105

{Since we now have the calendar, I'll give some dates:

Chapter 1: 20 Early Spring, 9 after New Moon 4, first-quarter moon, 105

Chapter 2:

Section 1:

Jayden leaves home: 25 Early Spring, 14 after New Moon 4, full moon, 105

Jayden arrives in Mountain Springs: 20 Middle Spring, 10 after New Moon 5, waxing gibbous moon, 105

Section 2: 21 Middle Spring, 11 after New Moon 5, waxing gibbous moon, 105

Chapter 3:

Section 1:

{Anything else that should be included?} Maybe you should include the programming guide? {Yes, that's a good idea.}

{Here is the programming guide for Lunra if you want to see that.}

### Programming Guide

# A Guide to Lunra

## Introduction

This guide aims to explain the small functional programming language Lunra so that the reader can read and write code in the language and understand some of its theoretical underpinnings. Lunra is not meant for overly complicated practical use, but for simple things it can work.

## Basic Information

Lunra is the typed lambda calculus with a few additions. These additions, while they are helpful, are not strong enough to make it Turing complete.

Lunra uses strict evaluation, not lazy evaluation. Thus, for example, even if a function is constant, its argument (if it has one) will still be evaluated.

## Syntax and Semantics

### Numbers and Variables

Lunra has only non-negative integers as numbers (0, 1, 2, ...). In particular, it does not have negative numbers or fractions. Ideally, numbers should be of arbitrary precision and size.

Lunra has a very permissive syntax for variables. A variable is basically anything nonempty without spaces or parenthesis other than numbers and the arrow ->. Variables are, of course, immutable. Note that \\ in variables is completely ignored; any occurrences of it are removed, so \\+\\ is the same as +.

### Function Application and Lambda Expressions

Function application of a function f (which may be a number (although this is nonsensical and will throw an error; a number cannot be used as a function), a variable, another function application, or a lambda expression) to a value x (which may be a number, variable, another function application, or a lambda expression) uses the following syntax:

(f x)

Note that (f x1 x2 ... xn) is equivalent to ((...((f x1) x2)...) xn). (Here and throughout, ... indicates removed material which can be inferred, not a literal ...) Note also that, as a degenerate case of the above, (x) is equivalent to x; this also holds for x a number, and will not throw an error in itself.

Lambda expressions are formed as follows:

(x1 x2 ... xn -> e)

where each x is a distinct variable and e is a number, variable, function application, or another lambda expression. If e is a function application, or another lambda expression, the outermost set of parenthesis surrounding e is not needed. For example, (x -> y -> 2) is valid and equivalent to (x -> (y -> 2)). Note that a lambda expression starting with an arrow is legal; for example, (-> 5).

Lambda expressions form functions. The behavior of these functions is defined by:

((x1 x2 ... xn -> e) y1 y2 ... yn)

being the value of e with any occurrences of the variables x1, ..., xn replaced by y1, ..., yn respectively. For example, ((x y -> y) 2 3) is 3. Note that in the degenerate case where the lambda expression starts with an arrow, the value of the lambda expression is simply its value with the arrow removed, so, for example, (-> 5) is 5. Note also that a variable used in one lambda expression cannot be used in another inside of that one, so, for example, (x -> (x -> 2)) will throw an error.

Variables before -> in lambda expressions can be put inside parentheses, even nested parentheses; as long as the parentheses match, this has no impact on the evaluation of the expression. For example, (x (y z) -> x (y z)), ((((x y)) (z)) -> x (y z)), and (x y z -> x (y z)) all evaluate to the same function. Note, however, that although (\\x y -> y x) and ((x y) -> y x) are both legal and the same as (x y -> y x), (\\(x y) -> y x) will throw an error.

### Variable Creation

New variables can be created via the syntax

var = value

New variables cannot have the same name as existing variables or be used in their own definition. Variables cannot be defined within other expressions. Note that this is allowed:

x = (x -> + x x)

This will make x be the doubling function.

### Special cases

Empty lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with #. Lines beginning with @ may have some special effect. If they do not, an error should be thrown. Lines containing but not beginning with @ or # should be allowed and handled normally.

## s and ^

(s x) is x + 1 for any number x. For any other x, a typechecking error will be thrown.

(^ f n x) is x if n = 0 and (f (^ f m x)) where m = n - 1 if n > 0. If n is not a number, a typechecking error will be thrown.

## Definitions

$ = (x -> x)

Note: This is the identity function.

. = (x y z -> x (y z))

Note: This is composition.

\` = (x y z -> x z y)

Note: This changes the order of the first two arguments.

v = (x -> ^ (y -> ^ (z w -> s (y w)) (y 1) (z -> z)) x (y -> 0) 0)

Note: This subtracts one from a number if that number is not 0, and otherwise returns 0. It was initially believed to be impossible to construct.

\+ = (^ s)

Note: This function adds two numbers.

\* = (x y -> ^ (^ s x) y 0)

Note: This function multiplies two numbers.

\- = (^ v)

Note: This function returns the maximum of 0 and the first argument minus the second. As noted above, Lunra has no negative numbers.

\< = (x y -> (^ (z -> 1) (- y x) 0))

Note: This function returns 1 if its first argument is less than its second argument and 0 otherwise.

\= = (x y -> (^ (z -> 0) (+ (- y x) (- x y)) 1))

Note: This function returns 1 if its first argument is equal to its second argument and 0 otherwise.

\> = (x y -> (^ (z -> 1) (- x y) 0))

Note: This function returns 1 if its first argument is greater than its second argument and 0 otherwise.

| = (x y -> (^ (z -> x) x y))

Note: This function returns its first argument if its first argument is not zero and its second argument otherwise.

& = (x y -> (^ (z -> y) x x))

Note: This function returns its first argument if its first argument is zero and its second argument otherwise.

! = (x -> (^ (z -> 0) x 1))

Note: This function returns 1 if its argument is 0 and 0 otherwise.

d = (x y z -> (^ (w -> y) z x))

Note: We've been using this function a lot in defining earlier functions. It returns its first argument if its third argument is zero; otherwise it returns its second argument.

κ = (x y -> x)

Note: This is known as the constant function; we've also been using it a lot.

ψ = (x y z -> x z (y z))

Note: ψ, κ, and $ can be combined to remove all lambda expressions from any expression via the following rules:

(remove n) for n a number or variable is n

(remove (f x)) is ((remove f) (remove x))

(remove (x -> n)) for n a number or variable other than x is (κ n)

(remove (x -> x)) is $

(remove (x -> (f y))) is (ψ (remove (x -> f)) (remove (x -> y)))

(remove (x -> (y -> e))) is (remove (x -> (remove (y -> e))))

Note that remove is not built into the language.

min = (x y -> d x y (> x y))

Note: This function takes the minimum of two numbers.

max = (x y -> d x y (< x y))

Note: This function takes the maximum of two numbers.

bool = (d 0 1)

Note: This function returns 0 if its argument is 1 and 0 otherwise.

\<\= = (x y -> (! (> x y))

Note: This function returns 1 if its first argument is less than or equal to its second argument and 0 otherwise.

\>\= = (x y -> (! (< x y))

Note: This function returns 1 if its first argument is greater than or equal to its second argument and 0 otherwise.

\*\* = (x y -> (^ (* x) y 1))

Note: This function returns its first argument to the power of its second argument. (** 0 0) is 1.

while = (f g -> ^ (x -> d x (g x) (f x)))

Note: This function actually takes four arguments. It repeatedly applies its second argument to its fourth argument while its first argument applied to the values of the repeated application is nonzero, up to its fourth argument times. This might be confusing, so here are some examples:

(while (> 100) s 50 5) is 55.

(while (> 100) s 500 5) is 100.

% = (x y -> (^ (z -> d (s z) 0 (= (s z) y)) x 0))

Note: This function returns its first argument modulo its second. If the second argument is 0, it just returns the first argument.

/ = (x y -> v (while (. (>= x) (* y)) s (s x) 0))

Note: This function returns its first argument divided by its second, rounded down (remember that Lunra has no fractions). If its second argument is 0, it just returns the first argument. Note that (x y -> while (. (> x) (* y)) s x 0) does division rounded up, otherwise behaving the same (in particular, it is the same when there is no remainder).

$$ = $

Note: This function is always the same as $ in eventual behavior, but is different in terms of time use. $$, if its argument is a function, memoizes it; that is, if it gets an input that is not a function, it stores the output, and next time that input it given, the output will be returned almost immediately. If $$ is given an argument that is not a function, including an argument that contains a function, it returns it with no changes. Also, if $$ is given a function that returns a function, it will only cache the partially applied results, as would be expected.

An example of when to use this function is in calculating the Fibonacci sequence. On the usual interpreter,

((y -> ^ (f -> $$ (x -> d 1 (+ (f (- x 1)) (f (- x 2))) (> x 2))) y $ y) 1000)

(to get the thousandth Fibonacci number) returns the answer almost immediately, but

((y -> ^ (f -> (x -> d 1 (+ (f (- x 1)) (f (- x 2))) (> x 2))) y $ y) 25)

(to get the 25th Fibonacci number) takes a few seconds.

## Sum and Product Types

### Sum and product types abstractly

Types can be thought of as collections of values. A sum type (| a b) (this is not code, just type notation) has a value of either a value in type a or a value in type b. A value of type a can clearly be converted into a value of type (| a b), as can a value of type b. However, there is not always a clear way to convert a value of type (| a b) to a value of type a (or, for that matter, to a value of type b).

A product type (& a b) has a value containing both a value in type a and a value in type b. From a value of type (& a b) it is clearly possible to get a value of type a, and also clearly possible to get a value of type b. However, given only a value of type a, or only a value of type b, there is no clear way to get a value of type (& a b). (In fact, theoretically (though not in Lunra) there might be empty types with no values, and if b were such an empty type and a were not there would clearly be no values of type (& a b), and thus there would be no functions from type a to type (& a b).)

Why are these called the sum and product types? Because, if types were to have finite numbers of values (which, in Lunra, none do), the number of values of type (| a b) would be the number of values of type a plus the number of values of type b, and the number of values of type (& a b) would be the number of values of type a times the number of values of type b. (Of course, there is no function to get the number of values of a type, so this would not help in adding and multiplying numbers.)

### Sum type

The sum type is defined by three functions <|, |>, and <|>, obeying the following laws:

(<|> f g (<| x)) = (f x)

(<|> f g (|> x)) = (g x)

The sum type can either be a left value (created by <|) or a right value (created by |>). <|>, given two functions f and g, applies one to a value of a sum type x, returning (f y) if x is a left value (<| y) and (g y) if x is a right value (|> y).

### Product type

The product type is defined by three functions <&, &>, and <&>, obeying the following laws:

(<& (<&> f g x)) = (f x)

(&> (<&> f g x)) = (g x)

The product type contains both a left value (extracted by <&) and a right value (extracted by &>). <&>, given two functions f and g, applies both to a single value x to create a value of a product type, the left value of which is (f x) and the right value of which is (g x).

## Further Definitions

/|/ = (f g -> <|> (. <| f) (. |> g))

Note: This function applies one of two functions to a value of a sum type depending upon whether it it a left (f) or right (g) value, but then makes the result of the function applied either a right or left value depending on which its input was.

\*\|\* = (x y -> <|> (κ x) (κ y))

Note: This function takes three arguments and returns x if its third argument is a left value and y if it is a right value.

/&/ = (f g -> <&> (. f <&) (. g &>))

Note: This function applies f to the left value of a value of a product type, g to the right value, and then returns the value of a product type containing both.

\*\&\* = (x y -> <&> (κ x) (κ y) $)

Note: This function constructs a value of a product type directly from two values. The use of $ could be any value; the choice of $ is insignificant.

## Example Programs

Ackermann function:

(\` (^ (f y -> ^ f y (f 1))) s)

or

(\` (^ (f -> \` (^ f) (f 1))) s)

or

(\` (^ (ψ (. \` ^) (\` $ 1))) s)

Program to compute the largest prime factor of a number:

(. <& (n -> ^ (x -> d (\*\&\* (. <& &> x) (\*\&\* (. <& &> x) (/ (. &> &> x) (. <& &> x)))) (\*\&\* (<& x) (\*\&\* (s (. <& &> x)) (. &> &> x))) (% (. &> &> x) (. <& &> x))) n (\*\&\* 0 (\*\&\* 2 n))))

## Other Information

### Optimizations

Optimization in writing a compiler or interpreter is permitted and indeed encouraged, but not required. It is typical to implement builtins more efficiently (that is, not directly in terms of their definitions). Cacheing even without $$ is also allowed.

### Exercises

Exercise 1. Someone wants to implement v by using while, specifically:

v = (x -> while (y -> (< (s y) x)) s x 0)

Will this work? Why or why not?

Exercise 2. Consider the sequence of functions (.), (. .), (. . .), etc. Are all these functions well-typed? Are they all the same after some point? If so, what do they "converge" to? Can we generate them with (n -> ^ . n $)?

Exercise 3. How might you represent a finite list of numbers in Lunra? How would you get the last item of such a list, or concatenate two such lists? What might be the use of cacheing in the implementation?

Exercise 4. Can you use a product type of two numbers in the definition of v rather than a function? How about a sum type of two numbers?

Exercise 5. Using just lambda expressions, 0, s, and ^, what is the shortest program you can write to calculate a number at least 2 ** 1024 (the classical number size limit)?

Exercise 6. How would you define bitwise operators on numbers in Lunra? Is there a limit to how efficiently you can do such operations?

Also, this last thing isn't classically in the guide, but I'm adding it as another interesting thing to think about.

pack of wolves, unicorn

seven people in desert, head person shot with arrow

[pick up Siara]

knights frightened by Siara's dragon illusion.

swamp which was once Gerenda, Hellish Llep (male) encounter.

same swamp, old tower (fire (passed by Siara's fire protection), quicksand (passed by being careful, having encountered quicksand before, and paddling through it), impassible trees (passed by sending a bird through and seeing through the eyes of that bird (Brian))), Malen isn't there.

Aidalaria, wild boar attack on Brian, they go to a local monastery and wait for his wounds to heal. Ultimately, they meet Ramon there, and he's important in chapter 7. He helps to repair the swamp which was once Gerenda by setting its ley lines back in place, and he does this along with Brian (who calls upon some of the nature spirits of the east to come to Gerenda).

Seven scenes in chapter 7:

unicorn (unique to 7)

fix the problem (6)

repair of Gerenda, step 1 (set up boundary conditions on ley lines) (5)

repair of Gerenda, step 2 (invite spirits from the east to occupy Gerenda) (4)

what happens back in the Fire monastery (3)

what happens to Jayden in the Endless Grassland (2)

what happens back in the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery and nearby areas (1)

final banishing of Carthn, with Ramon's help.
In 3.5: Tina says to Siara:
There are tons of relatively ways to banish this type of thing. Almost everyone in Aidelaria knows at least one (no insult intended, of course). Saying "Raenfidhre" is an easy way. The trouble is getting access to whatever you want to banish.
In 7.2, Ramon says, discussing ley lines:
Everything magical leaves a magical trace. (And, to answer the obvious question about recurrence, any trace also acts as its own trace.) Every type of magical effect that could happen on a thing leaves a trace. Even when a wizard or divine being merely watches over something, if they have the potential of doing something to it at any time, they leave a trace between themselves and the object watched over. (If they merely act on other things based on what they see, whether a trace is required is theoretically an open question, but the answer is believed to be yes.)
"Can you follow this trace to its source?"
Theoretically yes, but there are exceptions. For one thing, the source might be natural magic in the area, so there's nothing more significant to follow to. Also, you can make the path to the source go through somewhere with a lot of magical traces of various types, so it's hard to follow the specific one you want. But in general yes, and it takes special effort to make this harder. Also, somewhat similarly, due to boundary condition stuff, any magical event immediately creates widespread ripples (both on the trace and off of it) representing the change that its formation required to boundaries. But in these ripples it's very hard to separate any one thing out, unless it's really big, in which case care is required.

talk about Carthn and it will leave at least a magical trace, though it might not be summoned.

Also, earlier:

Onyy bs yvtug va bar zvahgr guvegl frpbaqf.

"Wait, what?"

Ignore that for now. In any case, there's an important result that the values of magical fields on a boundary of an area of space determine their values in the interior. Also the values at one time determine the values for all time, but the equations are chaotic so this can't be used to forecast magical events for more than about ten minutes.

"Wait, so you can predict future magic?"

"Yes."

"What am I going to do now?"

"Just do it."

"How will that be impressive? Once I've done it, you'll know. Can't you say beforehand?"

"Do it."

"OK."

"I said, encrypted, "ball of light in one minute thirty seconds""

"OK, impressive. But could we do another demonstration?"

"Yes. Nothing for at least the next five minutes, likely longer, though that other group of people nearby will do some magical communication."

I tried and tried, but for some reason my magic wasn't working. The other group of people did indeed do magical communication.

The interesting thing about dates:

The automatic plower can't be delivered until the winter solstice due to compatibility issues. Also, in the calendar it's 105.

Imbriel: 105 is, it turns out, the number of years since the most recent of the crashes, which are basically too much magic accumulating in Trakhathra and Trakhathra thus becoming too powerful and trying to break stuff, after which the situation is calmed down by the gods, who try to cover up as many traces of it as possible. Crashes occur every few hundred years. However, I have no evidence for this, but I would expect that things like this have started to be given out in Trakhathra already, so don't feel too bad. There have been three crashes so far. There are rumors that, very long ago, some people in the mysterious realms south of Azira made a prediction that there would be a crash. However, these rumors are almost certainly false, and furthermore the time of the supposedly predicted crash was before all the actual crashes, and instead was for a few centuries before the first crash. Take that as you will.

Later, Ramon: The equations of magic, given the current configuration, have some predictable long-term behavior. In particular, every 210 years, there's a peak in a certain component of the magical field. This component is at a low background level over the first half of each 210-year period, builds up over the second half, and then at the end suddenly returns to the background level. Strangely, the end of this period happens to be at the end of the year, at the winter solstice.

And hopefully that's enough for people to put it all together and get actual dates.

End calendar

It takes a few months to walk across. Probably 3 months is a reasonable assumption for Trakhathra to Circle Grove. Unclear, however.

Boars. Role of wild boars in sections 2 and 3 is important. I think in 3.2, a boar design should be pointed out? And of course this boar design seems like its importance is some abstract part of 3.3, but it's actually when someone gets injured by a boar in 5.

How does this actually play out?

Some ridiculous conversation about the boar design, where both sides somehow end up discussing the Great Boar War of 33, which never actually happened. Irari goes along with this since it seems suitably valorous. (How does it get a date, though? I think it's some type of logical confusion. Irari says something, the others jump to conclusions, and there you have your desired Great Boar War. But what in the world could Irari say that would make everyone that confused? What is the significance of the Great Boar War in the first place? I don't think it will be real.)

[Setting up the situation so that Lis went to get bags.]

[Other stuff.]

"What do you think about the boar design on the wall?"

"It's nice. I wonder what it came from?"

"There was a major successful boar hunt in 33. Also, the symbol of Mountain Creek is the boar." Irari said. After a slight pause, she continued "You know, the important thing about dealing with boars is that usually boars act as would be expected (generally peacefully, but of course less so if you're hunting them and they figure that out), but sometimes they go crazy and attack you for no discernible reason." {Advice about boars is not necessarily realistic. The narrator of this story takes no responsibility of any kind for any injuries relating or not relating to boars.} Irari currently seemed to be thinking of us as an audience for information about boars. Even though I was not generally interested in boars, I was OK with this, for several reasons. Firstly, [there's a limited amount of time, and time thinking about boars is time not reconsidering exile]. Secondly, [general area mindset]. Thirdly, although I had only seen one boar so far in Trakhathra and it ignored me, it seemed useful to know about them in case more showed up, especially since according to Irari they were potentially dangerous.

So

"So you went out "

In 3.5 Tina mentions some type of thing that randomly mentally injures people, "Someone in my monastery somehow got the ability to do quick mental math and accurate mental time measurement, both even without conscious effort, but they're obsessed with something they don't want to explain. I think it's some type of Fire effect (not to be insulting, of course)."
"That sounds bad."
"No, this is actually not all that rare. When you look into the divine the divine looks back into you, you know? It's the type of thing that usually isn't a problem but sometimes randomly hurts you."
"Yeah, we just [discussion of boars]."
"We have those in Aidelaria too, but random mental problems are overall a bigger issue here."

Jayden was allowed to stay since he played songs for the court of Mountain Creek, specifically, with the trumpet, which was generally used for military signaling. Apparently this is now invalidated.

Siara was allowed to stay since the Exalted Noble of Mountain Creek, Irari, wanted the support of her goddess, Imbriel, and Siara was the head of non-programming stuff (i.e., real-world stuff). She still mostly knew programming, though, but many of the top programmers didn't even travel. Siara could always find somewhere; not always the palace, but someone would be happy with a blessing.

[So, I made a puzzle, as I generally do when writing a story.]

[this chandelier falls in section 3, at the end. Section 3 is long, isn't it.]

[the god-convincing strategy is being kept silent because really, when you get free]

[2013 had a winter solstice (December 21 2012 in standard calendar) that was one day due to cancellation of an extra and missing day. 2013 was the first year 1.]

[year lengths (between Dec 21s or winter solstices) and overall discrepancies:

June 17 2018 is:
26 Late Spring, 6

The solstice in 2018 will be the 22nd, in this calendar. Actual value is 21st.

All dates in the story (or at least most) are:
something, 105.]

[13 December, 2012 is the first full moon.
After that:
29 days after a full moon is a full moon.]

[So 29 days for new moon purposes after 13 December, 2012 was really 30 days after, that is, January 12. Then February 10, etc.

June 13, 2018 was a new moon in this calendar.]

I promise by the Kirleb rock, all the AD references are going out of this story. Additionally, I will not play AD, look at the source of or any aspect of the github repo of AD (except in some aggregate form), look at the discord or subreddit of AD, or clone or commit to AD for a year, until Fall 7. The references to AD also include all AD mods, including those I created or am creating. Emails I get automatically from github don't count, but I can't further investigate them. And so it shall be.

Promises made by the Kirleb rock have never been broken, as far as is recorded. Interestingly, promises made by people standing on the Kirleb rock have also not been broken.

I'll probably use nethack as a reverse gateway drug. It's moderately addictive but nowhere near as much as AD. AD really is the game that could end the world.
