click: clicking to get zeros does maxall,
every other way to buy doublings or numbers is disabled (but not shifts or boosts),
you can click at most 1024 times (after that clicking displays a message saying
"You've used all your clicks! Either wait or exit the challenge.")
autobuyer: clicks every 1s
1: every second, if you have more than zero bought ones, you lose one
(you don't lose any amount ones). If you have zero bought ones, you reset
(like a boost without the bonus, keeping prior boosts and shifts)
autobuyer: buys ones every 2s
2: whenever you buy anything or reset, production drops to 0%
(multiplier on all production) and goes linearly to 100% over two minutes.
autobuyer: buys twos every 4s
3: whenever you reset, all production gains a 1/343 multiplier
which grows exponentially, multiplies by 7 every 7 minutes (so after 21 minutes
production is normal and after that it just gets better)
autobuyer: buys threes every 8s
4: every 4 seconds you lose all numbers (including zero if you have anything higher)
but the highest number you have any of (you don't lose bought)
autobuyer: buys fours every 16s
5: every 5 seconds you buy max, and production is divided by total numbers bought
in current reset
autobuyer: buys fives every 32s
6: doubling costs are in previous number (like number costs are),
but start at 6 and multiply by 6 every purchase
autobuyer: buys sixes every 64s
7: each doubling multiplies by a logarithmically random number from 1/2 to 7
(multiplies with IP purchases).
autobuyer: buys sevens every 128s
doublings: each doubling only multiplies by 1.9 (multiplies with IP purchases).
autobuyer: buys doublings every 256s
shifts: you can only shift 5 times (not 6)
autobuyer: shifts every 512s
boosts: you can't boost
autobuyer: boosts every 1024s
infinity: your production is multiplied by 1 - (fraction to infinity)
so at 2^1023 it's multiplied by 1/1024
autobuyer: infinities every 2048s

Note: the term "production" does not include clicks.
Note: Autobuyers 1-7 have a single/max choice.
Note: You can make an autobuyer's actual interval be longer than or equal to
its allowed interval.
Note: There is one doubling and one boost autobuyer.
They both have individual sub-priority arrays, and the
doubling autobuyer has seven single/max choices.
Note: Halving the interval of an autobuyer starts out costing 1 IP and
doubles for each purchase. There is no bulk.
Note: The minimum autobuyer interval is one-eighth of a second.

decrease doubling cost multiplier increase

[Note: if nx per infinity, then going infinite with x zeros gives
n^(log(x)/log(infinity) - 1) infinity points]

[Note: Last transitions of fewer sevens for stars and
decrease doubling cost multiplier increase
might be too powerful, test carefully]

finish the top 5 rows of achievements to break infinity

stars are a new prestige layer (between shifts and infinity)
stars initially cost 343 sevens each, but this can be decreased
once you get a star, you unlock a stars tab.
Each star produces 1 star power per second. Star power produces a
max(1, (star power)) ** stars boost to all production.
Star power resets on infinity.

Extragalactic: When star power reaches 2^128,
"The galaxy is too full of stars and collapses into a black hole"
and you have to "Go to a new galaxy"
This gives you +1 to black holes and +1 galaxy points.

Cost increases: Once doubling costs go over infinity,
for each doubling gotten the cost multiplier increases by a factor of x = 2.
In other words, the order is:
Get production doubling for current cost.
Multiply cost.
If cost > Infinity, multiply cost multiplier.
There is no such effect for numbers themselves.

Sixth row:

Limit break: Break infinity.

Much upgrade. Such power. So wow.: Max all the top 4 rows of infinity upgrades.

No one needs that many boosts: Get 100 total boosts.
Reward: Boost power is boost power^(7/6).

This is hell: Get sum of challenge times under 6.66 minutes.
[Note: actually 6 and two thirds.]
Reward: Boost to production based of sum of challenge times.
[Note: This boost is max(10m / sum, 1)x]

You're a star: Get a star.

Luminosity: Get 1000 star power. Reward: Star power generation doubled.

That many at once?: Get over 1000 infinity points by going infinite once.
Reward: Infinity points from going infinity are raised to the 7/6 power.
[Note: That is, if you would have gotten 64, you get 128 instead.]

Seventh row:

It's night now: Get 3 stars. Reward: Star power generation tripled.

Maximum speed: Max all the autobuyers.

Moar anafabula: Get the multiplier from achievement 2747 to be at least 2747. Reward: The multiplier from achievement 2747 is squared.

My eyes hurt: Get 1e6 star power.

2 million infinities? Nah, that's too hard.: Get 2 million infinity points. Reward: Infinities at least 5 seconds give double the infinity points.

You broke the upgrades: Max all the break infinity upgrades.

But I didn't want another prestige layer: Go extragalactic.

Fourth row:

Daredevil: Complete a challenge.

That's fast: Go infinite in 1 hour. Reward: Start with 7^3 zeros.

One's even enough: Go infinite with only one seven.
[Note: this only considers what you have when you reach infinity.]
Reward: All numbers but sevens are 7/6x stronger.

Why were boosts afraid of seven?: Boost sevens.

Some one needs to nerf that II: Produce 1e6 zeros per second with a single one
and nothing else without any shifts or boosts.

Anti-invasion from the eighth dimension!: Get the production multipliers in
reversed order. [So one production multiplier < two production multiplier ...
< seven production multiplier.] Reward: number n gets nx production multiplier.

That's a lot of infinities: Go infinite 10 times.

Fifth row:

Anti-challenged: Complete all the challenges.

That's faster: Go infinite in 1 minute. Reward: Start with 7^9 zeros.

How did you do that?: Go infinite having shifted no more than 5 times and not boosted at all.

We ain't ever getting over: Infinity without your zeros ever getting over
your zeros per second. Reward: Ones get 2x multiplier.

Many stoppages: Complete Challenge 2 in 2 minutes. Reward: Boost to
production over first two minutes of infinity.
[Note: Boost is max(2 / (minutes + 2 ** -16), 1)x]

Exponential doesn't mean fast: Complete Challenge 3 in 3 minutes.
Reward: exponential boost to all production over first 21 minutes,
vanishing over next 21.
[Note: Boost is max(1, 7 ** (3 - abs(minutes / 7 - 3)))x]

Everything is done for you: Go infinite without at all manually clicking,
buying, or resetting. [Note: This includes going infinite itself.]
