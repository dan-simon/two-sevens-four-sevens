"Hi, my name is Siara. What's yours?" she asked me. I replied "My name is Jayden. Where are you from? What god do you worship?" She answered "I am from Azira, specifically a region called Tumlunra. I am a follower of Imbriel, goddess of the moon. Where are you from?" I replied "I am from Kaze, in the east. I don't really like it there, though, since not that much ever happens. We don't have wars, we don't have mysterious magical object or wizards, we don't even have gods. I came here in search of adventure."

more real:

"Hi, my name is Siara. What's yours?" I asked him. He replied, "My name is Jayden. Where are you from? What god do you worship?" I answered "I am from Azira, specifically a region called Tumlunra. I am a follower of Imbriel, goddess of the moon. Where are you from?" I generally thought asking analogous questions was a good conversational technique, but for the obvious reason I could only do that for one of the two questions I was asked. Jayden replied "I am from Kaze, in the east. I don't really like it there, though, since not that much ever happens. We don't have-" I was somewhat worried about what Jayden would mention as not being in Kaze, so I interrupted. "I see. So you came here looking for more exciting things?" "Yes, exactly." Jayden said. "I had heard the ancient legends of Trakhathra, so I went west to it."

Siara knows Jayden is from Kaze, so maybe she should say that?
But Siara

START

"Hi, my name is Siara. What's yours?" I asked him. He replied, "My name is Jayden. Where are you from? What god do you worship?" I answered, "I am from Azira, specifically a region called Tumlunra. I am a follower of Imbriel, goddess of the moon." I wanted to also ask some sort of follow-up question. I liked the conversational technique of asking someone a question that they had asked you, since it helped continue the conversation in a way that the other person was probably at least somewhat used to. However, I already knew where Jayden was from (and asking out of politeness would be weird since Irari knew that I knew), and the situation with respect to what deity Jayden worshipped was very fragile.

As I was thinking about what to say next, Jayden said, "I am from Kaze, in the east. I don't really like it there, though, since not that much ever happens. We don't have-" I was glad that the annoying break in the conversation had been filled, but for the obvious reason I did not want Jayden to mention things Kaze didn't have, so I interrupted. "I think I see. So you came here looking for more exciting things?" "Yes, exactly." Jayden said. "I had heard the ancient legends of Trakhathra, so I went west to it." "And what do you think so far?" I asked. I realized, right after I finished speaking, that, given the situation, Jayden's expressed opinion of Mountain Creek would likely be more positive than his actual opinion.

"It's very nice," Jayden said. I felt that this was probably the type of thing someone would say if they wanted to sound positive but didn't actually want to say anything positive of substance, or if they were distracted by something else (which did not seem to be the case here). "What's your opinion about it?" Wanting to give a somewhat (but not necessarily much) more substantial reply but still offer praise, I replied "I think it's amazing. The majesty of the mountains framed against the sky is not something I generally get to see, and the deep history of the landscape only adds to that effect. Not to insult the waving fields of Kaze, of course." "[Or the fruit trees of the valleys of Gerenda, which have the additional advantage of often having edible fruit on them, which is practically useful sometimes.]" I thought, but did not say. "Yes, that is true." Jayden said. "As it is sung in the Poetic Speech, ???"

[more? something is definitely missing]

"Here are your possessions," she said, giving me my bag, which I assumed had been searched. I did a few checks for random things to make sure nothing had been taken, and indeed what had been there still seemed to be there, though it had been scrambled. "What about Jayden?" I asked, seeing that nothing had been given to him. "I didn't take a bag," Jayden said. This very much surprised me, but for now I decided not to say anything. If something strange was going on, this was probably not a good place and time to discuss it.

"How far will you be coming with us?" I asked, not wanting to end up going with her all the way to the FP Conference. "I'm just taking you out of the town," she said. "Then I will inform the town and palace guards to not let you back in." There was no way for me to know whether this was going to be true, but in any case there was not much I could do if she followed further, so without further ado I let her lead the way out.

As we walked through the palace, I felt a mental message. "[Is this an OK time to talk?]" I intuitively understood that the mental message was from Imbriel. Talking to Imbriel was not that uncommon for me, due to her rather small number of followers (a few thousand). Since I wasn't talking to anyone else at the moment, I replied, "[Yes, of course it is.]"

"[I just consciously saw what happened.]" said Imbriel. "[I just wanted to let you know that if you need help, you should call on me rather than just mentioning me. I might be busy, but if you actually call on me, I'll notice, talk with you, and ask what you want me to do, rather than just subconsciously doing things. Some deities will only help their followers every so often, or won't let their followers ask what help they want. For those deities, this strategy is doubtlessly an overall clever trick to avoid getting too many requests, but I don't have that problem.]"

"[Ok, if that's what you want.]" I said. "[Thank you for noticing and telling me what to do next time. But I think as it was, the situation happened to turn out reasonably well.]"

I felt a feeling of doubt about my most recent statement, though it was unclear whether its source was Imbriel, me, or some other thing. I was glad to have gotten out safely, but Carthn was still an open issue that needed to be somehow resolved. However, on reflection, [???]

At this point, we had left the palace. With Lis there, neither I nor Jayden really wanted to talk to each other further, and Lis seemed fine with this, not herself initiating conversation, but rather leading us onwards through the town. Rather soon, we exited the town through its gate (or perhaps one of its gates, though this seemed to be the same gate I entered through, so it was unclear whether there was in fact more than one gate). Lis then said "Your exile has begun. Go and do not come back." Happy that indeed Lis seemed to not want to follow us further, I did indeed walk away, until Lis and the town walls were in the distance.
