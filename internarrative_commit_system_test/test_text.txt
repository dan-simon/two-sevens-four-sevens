Region 1 is Kaze. It primarily consists of grassland. It is heavily farmed, is moderately populated, and has no overall government, though there are some regional governments without that much power. Its associated element is soil.

Region 2 is Tosari. It primarily consists of mountains, with some high grasslands in between, and some rocky areas without true mountains in the east. It continues north, and it is unknown where or whether it ever ends, and if so what replaces it. It is generally rather uncivilized, though it does have a distinct culture, said to have come from across the Western Ocean. It is very sparsely populated; people often live alone, and what towns exist are small. It has no government of any type (except for some town governments). Its associated element is stone.

Region 3 is Trakhathra. It primarily consists of mountains, though there are some grasslands and deserts at the boundaries. It is somewhat more civilized than Tosari, and moderately populated. It is divided into a number of counties, each ruled over by a noble. Generally the rule of nobles in Trakhathra is more tight than the rule of the government anywhere else. There is no central government and the nobles often fight. It is known for its wars and its mining industry. Its associated element is metal.

Region 4 is Niraina. It primarily consists of forest, with some grassland in the west. It is unknown how far north and east it extends, and there are rumors of an Eastern Ocean to its east (not to be confused with the Southeastern Ocean shown on the map, though they may connect). It is also unknown what shape and size the northern lake (or perhaps lakes) shown in it in the map are, but their shown location is believed to be roughly correct. There are a few large cities in the west of Niraina, but it is otherwise sparsely populated. There is no central government; there are a lot of towns and small settlements scattered throughout, however, with varying levels of civilization. Niraina's associated element is wood.

Region 5 is Azira. It primarily consists of desert, though there are some areas (especially further south) which actually get enough rain for easy farming. It is unknown how far south it extends, but it is believed to end and be replaced by dense forest somewhere to the south. There are a few large cities, but otherwise Azira is sparsely populated. It is divided into many regions of various sizes, each with a distinct level of civilization and a distinct type of government. Tumlunra, in which I live, is a small region roughly in the north-middle of Azira, not as dry as most of the west. It is (from my perspective; I am of course biased) one of the more civilized areas of Azira. Azira's associated element is fire, and most worshippers of Fire deities live there.

Region 6 is Gerenda. It primarily consists of meadows, but it has all types of ecosystems. It has many large cities, is very civilized, and has a central government. This is generally attributed to the presence of many wizards in Gerenda, though the exact chain of logic in this attribution is not completely clear. The main industries are farming and magic. Its associated element is water.

Region 7 is Aidelaria. It primarily consists of forest and gets a lot of mist and rain. It is generally believed, but not known for sure, that if you go far enough north, the eastern border of Aidelaria meets the ocean. It has a few large cities, but like Niraina it mostly has small settlements without a central government. Its associated element is air, and most worshippers of Air deities live there.
