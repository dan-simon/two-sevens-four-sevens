<h2>Two Sevens, Four Sevens</h2>

<p>{Hi! I'm the story's narrator. I only talk in these curly brackets. This story is first-person, with multiple perspectives, but none of them (other than the stuff in curly brackets), is me. This is a fantasy story, with small amounts of divine magic.}</p>

<h4>1.</h4>

<p>Having everything collapse around you is, to put it lightly, not that great. Thus, it was somewhat worrisome when I was woken up by a loud noise of breaking and a feeling of sudden freefall, followed by a shock which, though I was still half-asleep, I determined to be due to my bed landing on the first floor. I looked at the scene around me. My first reaction was that the damage was heavily localized; above me, the third floor seemed fine, and the rest of the second floor also seemed to be undamaged. My second reaction was noticing the tree. A few branches of it were lying near me, and I realized that, most likely, the collapse was due to it falling though the wall separating my room from the outside, then breaking through the floor and causing the floor to collapse. It was lucky, I thought, that it had happened to fall near my bed rather than on it, and for that matter that my bed had stayed upright during its (albeit brief) fall. Then I looked in more detail at the tree.</p>

<p>{Commentary on the next paragraph: it's hard to find a word for what I want to mean by "monastery". Some of the monasteries in this society are what we would consider monasteries, where people work on spiritual stuff. Others are more like universities. This one is sort of in between. It was initially formed "to recognize the goodness and beauty of nature and especially trees", but over time it's started studying them from a more scientific perspective. In any case, in this society the distinctions are viewed as more of a spectrum of types of isolated gatherings of more than a few people.}</p>

<p>As a member of the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery, which focused mostly on the study of trees and specifically the eponymous circular grove of seven trees, and also as someone who liked looking out my window at that grove (which wasn't really a grove, being more like seven trees in the forest that formed a rather small circle inside which there were no other trees), I had a rough idea of the trees that could have been the one that fell. After about a minute, going though the possibilities and considering the orientation, color, and size of the tree, I realized that it was one of the trees from the grove. Then I noticed that since the tree had destroyed the wall, and though the sun had not risen yet there was enough light to see by, I could have just followed it back though the forest and found where its base was. Doing so, I found that the tree was indeed from the grove. "How stupid I am for not having checked that first," I though. "Or perhaps I'm just still sleepy." Then I realized that I should be focusing on the fact that one of the seven trees of the grove fell, and tried to figure out just how bad that was.</p>

<p>At this point, enough time had passed that other people, having been woken up by the noise of the tree collapse, had started to come to the scene. In response to people's concern, I told everyone that I was not hurt, just a bit shocked. It was fairly clear to everyone that there was not that much that both could and needed to be done immediately. Aren, the leader of the monastery, announced that things would generally go on as usual, the monastery elders would meet during the day, and at the end of the day they would announce what the response would be. The only immediate action he took was to offer me one of the guest rooms (which were on the second floor) for me to sleep in and put my possessions in until the repairs were finished, an offer which I of course took. Everyone went back to their rooms, happy that no one was hurt and that the issue was localized and no longer dangerous but unhappy that one of the trees of the grove had fallen.</p>

<p>The guest room faced west, opposite to my room, which faced east. Unlike my old room, which faced the forest directly, the guest room thus faced a clearing, which contained a small farm for producing those types of food which could not be gathered from nature, and was large enough that one could see, poking over the trees, Mount Erci, a beautiful lone ice-topped mountain in the distance {yes, this is possible as an isolated extinct volcano, though it is rare; Mount Kilimanjaro is a real-world example}. Other than the view, it was much like my room had been, though without as much in it.</p>

<p>I started to look for my stuff among what had fallen and to take it upstairs. This was comparatively easy for a variety of reasons. The glass from my window {yes, I know glass windows became generally common only a few centuries ago, but don't complain about historical inaccuracy; the setting is medieval but with some modern things which have no especially good reason to not exist} was all in one area, and could generally be avoided without too much difficulty. The only thing that broke was my bookcase, which while taking up my books I tried (and largely, though not completely, succeeded) to avoid getting splinters from. A few things were crushed by the tree, but not many, and not the really important ones. The guest room had a bed, table, and chest of drawers {remember what I said about not complaining}, which were the only things which would have been too large for me to carry. This task occupied me for a few hours, and when I was done, it was time for breakfast.</p>

<p>I went to the dining hall and took my share of the food. Apparently what was being served today was a new variation on oatmeal I vaguely remembered Tarnas proposing to make. His idea, which I think he had heard from someone traveling through, was, generally speaking, instead of boiling the combination of oats and milk, to stir it and refrigerate it overnight. {Really, stop complaining. Ice pits have been a thing for a long time, and there's an ice-topped mountain close enough to be visible.} He voluntarily did a large share of the work at the monastery farm, which very few people really wanted to do and which was generally assigned to people on specific days. In addition, due to the farm producing a lot of the ingredients, he also did some of the food preparation. Due to these facts, we were willing to let him try it, but I, at least, upon eating it, didn't think it was that great, though it wasn't terrible either. {I, the narrator, have not done this and don't really like oatmeal in general that much. As a general rule, don't attribute attitudes from characters to me.}</p>

<p>As I was eating, I overheard a lot of discussion about the tree falling and what the response would be. It was, of course, generally agreed that the damage to the building would be repaired, but it was unclear what would happen to the site of the tree. Would nothing happen, and the Circle Grove only have six trees? Would a seedling be transplanted? Would a whole tree be transplanted? (This was viewed as unlikely unless someone managed to do it via powerful magic, which was uncommon in this part of the world.) There was also a small amount of discussion about whether the fall was fully coincidence. There had not been a storm or strong winds last night, but on the other hand the tree was getting old, and why would anyone have wanted it to collapse? Many people planned to go to the site of the Circle Grove and look at the damage for themselves, which was of course rather easy since it was so close.</p>

<p>After finishing breakfast, I had assigned farm duty for the morning, but given the circumstance I thought it was reasonable to take a quick peek at the Circle Grove first. There were some other people there looking at the fallen tree, but the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery had only 68 people, only about 20 were there, and we weren't crowding in too close, so the view wasn't obstructed. The roots of the fallen tree were showing, and it seemed to have fallen down randomly rather than due to someone undermining it. All the other trees, fortunately, seemed fine; the tree that fell was the one closest to the monastery building, and so did not fall onto or between any of the others. Having seen the situation up close, I left the Circle Grove and headed to the farm.</p>

<p>When I reached the farm, I saw Tarnas there, feeding the cows. "How did you think the new type of oats were?" he asked me. "To be honest, they were okay but not great," I replied. "They weren't quite as good as I expected, either," Tarnas said. "I think it was worth trying them, but I'm probably not going to make them again." "That seems reasonable, and I'm glad we tried them. What farm work should I do?" I asked. "Well, I'm feeding the cows and am going to move on to the chickens, so you can weed one of the unweeded parts of the field and water the crops, unless you'd rather handle the chickens," Tarnas replied. I felt that this plan was (somewhat literally) giving me the dirty work, but since Tarnas was already dealing with the animals, it seemed to make sense for him to take care of the chickens, so I agreed to weed and water the crops.</p>

<p>The tending of the crops was fairly uneventful; I first looked among a certain area of the crops and uprooted the weeds in that area, then took a few buckets of water from the nearby stream (not as close as the grove and farm, but still close) and poured them on the field. When I was done, it had been a few hours, and my farming duty for the day was done. I told Tarnas which area I had weeded and left the farm. {I'm not a farmer; if you are, you can (but shouldn't feel obligated to) improve this and the prior paragraph and give me the improved version.}</p>

<p>During the afternoon I wandered in the woods, which was, unsurprisingly, a common activity among those in the Circle Grove Wilderness Monastery. Not much of significance happened. I saw a tree with very bent branches, a few deer, a rabbit; all of these were usual sights in the area. When the sun became low, I headed back to the monastery building.</p>

<p>It turned out that when I got back, Aren was about to announce the details of the response to the tree falling in the main hall, which was where I entered. Almost everyone was there, except a few people which were presumably out in the forest like I had been. After a few minutes, Aren began to talk. He said the following: "Firstly, we are all, though happy that no one was killed by the tree collapse, unhappy that Brian's room was destroyed by it. We will repair the damage to that area as soon as possible, and Brian has been given a guest room in the meantime. Secondly, we have concluded that the tree fell merely because it was getting old, and there was no intent either to knock down a tree from the Circle Grove or to hurt anyone in particular. Thirdly, although we may want to consider the spiritual implications of a tree from the Circle Grove, which is the cause of the existence of this monastery, falling, the tree fall ultimately does not have that much importance; one could take it as a sign of doom, but it seems more probable that it is simply the fall of a tree, especially since it would have to be a rather small doom to knock down only one of seven trees. Although there have been mystical analyses of the meaning of there being seven trees in the Circle Grove, there probably could be analyses showing the exact same things with six. Thus, we feel no need to replace the tree. We will let new seedlings grow in the place where the tree fell, and eventually one of them may be a new part of the Circle Grove." The speech was done. The main thing people seemed to be talking about afterwards was the potential for doom, which Aren, according to many of the people there, did not do enough to show the unlikelihood of. I personally though that reading doom into a tree collapse was going overboard, and that the monastery was going to be fine. After a few minutes of listening to this discussion that I considered unimportant, I went upstairs to my new room, entered my bed, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>{To avoid confusion, I will say that the viewpoint character of this chapter is not the same as that of the previous chapter. In fact, the viewpoint character of a chapter is never the same as that of the previous chapter.}</p>

<p>I woke up from the knocking on my door. It was not the quiet knocking of someone who would like to get your attention but doesn't really care that much. It was the loud knocking of someone who needs to get in for some reason and is likely going to break down the door if nothing happens.</p>
